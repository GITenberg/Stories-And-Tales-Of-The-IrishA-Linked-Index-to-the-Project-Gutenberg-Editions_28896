    <h3>
      Fardorougha, the Miser.
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was on one of those nights in August, when the moon and stars shine
      through an atmosphere clear and cloudless, with a mildness of lustre
      almost continental, that a horseman, advancing at a rapid pace, turned off
      a remote branch of road up a narrow lane, and, dismounting before a neat
      whitewashed cottage, gave a quick and impatient knock at the door. Almost
      instantly, out of a small window that opened on hinges, was protruded a
      broad female face, surrounded, by way of nightcap, with several folds of
      flannel, that had originally been white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mary Moan at home?&rdquo; said the horseman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a miricle-ay!&rdquo; replied the female; &ldquo;who&rsquo;s <i>down</i>, in the name o&rsquo; 
      goodness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, thin, I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll be smilin&rsquo; whin you hear it,&rdquo; replied the
      messenger. &ldquo;The sorra one else than Honor Donovan, that&rsquo;s now marrid upon
      Fardorougha Donovan to the tune of thirteen years. Bedad, time for her,
      anyhow,&mdash;but, sure it&rsquo;ll be good whin it comes, we&rsquo;re thinkin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, betther late than never&mdash;the Lord be praised for all His
      gifts, anyhow. Put your horse down to the mountin&rsquo;-stone, and I&rsquo;ll be wid
      you in half a jiffy, acushla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She immediately drew in her head, and ere the messenger had well placed
      his horse at the aforesaid stirrup, or mounting-stone, which is an
      indispensable adjunct to the midwife&rsquo;s cottage, she issued out, cloaked
      and bonneted; for, in point of fact, her practice was so extensive, and
      the demands upon her attendance so incessant, that she seldom, if ever,
      slept or went to bed, unless partially dressed. And such was her habit of
      vigilance, that she ultimately became an illustration of the old Roman
      proverb, <i>Non dormio omnibus</i>; that is to say, she could sleep as
      sound as a top to every possible noise except a knock at the door, to
      which she might be said, during the greater part of her professional life,
      to have been instinctively awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having ascended the mounting-stone, and placed herself on the crupper, the
      guide and she, while passing down the narrow and difficult lane, along
      which they could proceed but slowly and with caution, entered into the
      following dialogue, she having first turned up the hood of her cloak over
      her bonnet, and tied a spotted cotton kerchief round her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; said the guide, who was Fardorougha Donovan&rsquo;s servant-man, &ldquo;is a
      quare enough business, as some o&rsquo; the nabors do be sayin&mdash;marrid upon
      one another beyant thirteen year, an&rsquo; ne&rsquo;er a sign of a haporth. Why then
      begad it is quare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whisht, whisht,&rdquo; replied Molly, with an expression of mysterious and
      superior knowledge; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be spakin&rsquo; about what you don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;sure,
      nuttin&rsquo;s impossible to God, avick&mdash;don&rsquo;t you know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bedad, sure enough&mdash;that we must allow, whether or not, still&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; seein&rsquo; that, what more have we to say, barrin&rsquo; to hould our
      tongues. Children sent late always come either for great good or great
      sarra to their parents&mdash;an&rsquo; God grant that this may be for good to
      the honest people&mdash;for indeed honest people they are, by all
      accounts. But what myself wonders at is, that Honor Donovan never once
      opened her lips to me about it. However, God&rsquo;s will be done! The Lord send
      her safe over all her throubles, poor woman! And, now that we&rsquo;re out o&rsquo; 
      this thief of a lane, lay an for the bare life, and never heed me. I&rsquo;m as
      good a horseman as yourself; and, indeed, I&rsquo;ve a good right, for I&rsquo;m an
      ould hand at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she added, after a short silence, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s odd I never was
      much acquainted with the Donovans. I&rsquo;m tould they&rsquo;re a hard pack, that
      loves the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix,&rdquo; replied her companion, &ldquo;Let Fardorougha alone for knowin&rsquo; the
      value of a shillin&rsquo;!&mdash;they&rsquo;re not in Europe can hould a harder grip
      o&rsquo; one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His master, in fact, was a hard, frugal man, and his mistress a woman of
      somewhat similar character; both were strictly honest, but, like many
      persons to whom God has denied offspring, their hearts had for a
      considerable time before been placed upon money as their idol; for, in
      truth, the affections must be fixed upon something, and we generally find
      that where children are denied, the world comes in and hardens by its
      influence the best and tenderest sympathies of humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a journey of two miles they came out on a hay-track, that skirted an
      extensive and level sweep of meadow, along which they proceeded with as
      much speed as a pillionless midwife was capable of bearing. At length, on
      a gentle declivity facing the south, they espied in the distance the low,
      long, whitewashed farm-house of Fardorougha Donovan. There was little of
      artificial ornament about the place, but much of the rough, heart-stirring
      wildness of nature, as it appeared in a strong, vigorous district, well
      cultivated, but without being tamed down by those finer and more graceful
      touches, which nowadays mark the skilful hand of the scientific
      agriculturist.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the left waved a beautiful hazel glen, which gradually softened away
      into the meadows above mentioned. Up behind the house stood an ancient
      plantation of whitethorn, which, during the month of May, diffused its
      fragrance, its beauty, and its melody, over the whole farm. The plain
      garden was hedged round by the graceful poplar, whilst here and there were
      studded over the fields either single trees or small groups of mountain
      ash, a tree still more beautiful than the former. The small dells about
      the farm were closely covered with blackthorn and holly, with an
      occasional oak shooting up from some little cliff, and towering sturdily
      over its lowly companions. Here grew a thick interwoven mass of dog-tree,
      and upon a wild hedgerow, leaning like a beautiful wife upon a rugged
      husband, might be seen, supported by clumps of blackthorn, that most
      fragrant and exquisite of creepers, the delicious honeysuckle. Add to this
      the neat appearance of the farm itself, with its meadows and cornfields
      waving to the soft sunny breeze of summer, and the reader may admit, that
      without possessing any striking features of pictorial effect, it would,
      nevertheless, be difficult to find an uplying farm upon which the eye
      could rest with greater satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ere arriving at the house they were met by Fardorougha himself, a small
      man, with dark, but well-set features, which being at no time very placid,
      appeared now to be absolutely gloomy, yet marked by strong and profound,
      anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; he exclaimed on meeting them; &ldquo;is this Mary Moan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is&mdash;it is!&rdquo; she exclaimed; &ldquo;how are all within?&mdash;am I in
      time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only poorly,&rdquo; he returned; &ldquo;you are, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The midwife, when they reached the door, got herself dismounted in all
      haste, and was about entering the house, when Fardorougha, laying his hand
      upon her shoulder, said in a tone of voice full of deep feeling&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I need say nothing to you; what you can do, you will do&mdash;but one
      thing I expect&mdash;if you see danger, call in assistance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all in the hands o&rsquo; God, Fardorougha, acushla; be as aisy in your
      mind as you can; if there&rsquo;s need for more help you&rsquo;ll hear it; so keep the
      man an&rsquo; horse both ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then blessed herself and entered the house, repeating a short prayer,
      or charm, which was supposed to possess uncommon efficacy in relieving
      cases of the nature she was then called upon to attend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fardorougha Donovan was a man of great good sense, and of strong, but not
      obvious or flexible feeling; this is to say, on strong occasions he felt
      accordingly, but exhibited no remarkable symptoms of emotion. In matters
      of a less important character, he was either deficient in sensibility
      altogether, or it affected him so slightly as not to be perceptible. What
      his dispositions and feelings might have been, had his parental affections
      and domestic sympathies been cultivated by the tender intercourse which
      subsists between a parent and his children, it is not easy to say. On such
      occasions many a new and delightful sensation&mdash;many a sweet trait of
      affection previously unknown&mdash;and, oh! many, many a fresh impulse of
      rapturous emotion never before felt gushes out of the heart; all of which,
      were it not for the existence of ties so delightful, might have there lain
      sealed up forever. Where is the man who does not remember the strange
      impression of tumultuous delight which he experienced on finding himself a
      husband? And who does not recollect that nameless charm, amounting almost
      to a new sense, which pervaded his whole being with tenderness and
      transport on kissing the rose-bud lips of his first-born babe? It is,
      indeed, by the ties of domestic life that the purity and affection and the
      general character of the human heart are best tried. What is there more
      beautiful than to see that fountain of tenderness multiplying its
      affections instead of diminishing them, according as claim after claim
      arises to make fresh demands upon its love? Love, and especially parental
      love, like jealousy, increases by what it feeds on. But, oh! from what an
      unknown world of exquisite enjoyment are they shut out, to whom Providence
      has not vouchsafed those beloved beings on whom the heart lavishes the
      whole fulness of its rapture! No wonder that their own affections should
      wither in the cold gloom of disappointed hope, or their hearts harden into
      that moody spirit of worldly-mindedness which adopts for its offspring the
      miser&rsquo;s idol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether Fardorougha felt the want of children acutely or otherwise, could
      not be inferred from any visible indication of regret on his part by those
      who knew him. His own wife, whose facilities of observation were so great
      and so frequent, was only able to suspect in the affirmative. For himself
      he neither murmured nor repined; but she could perceive that, after a few
      years had passed, a slight degree of gloom began to settle on him, and an
      anxiety about his crops, and his few cattle, and the produce of his farm.
      He also began to calculate the amount of what might be saved from the
      fruits of their united industry. Sometimes, but indeed upon rare
      occasions, his temper appeared inclining to be irascible or impatient; but
      in general it was grave, cold, and inflexible, without any outbreaks of
      passion, or the slightest disposition to mirth. His wife&rsquo;s mind, however,
      was by no means so firm as his, nor so free from the traces of that secret
      regret which preyed upon it. She both murmured and repined, and often in
      terms which drew from Fardorougha a cool rebuke for her want of
      resignation to the will of God. As years advanced, however, her
      disappointment became harassing even to herself, and now that hope began
      to die away, her heart gradually partook of the cool worldly spirit which
      had seized upon the disposition of her husband, Though cultivating but a
      small farm, which they held at a high rent, yet, by the dint of frugality
      and incessant diligence, they were able to add a little each year to the
      small stock of money which they had contrived to put together. Still would
      the unhappy recollection that they were childless steal painfully and
      heavily over them; the wife would sometimes murmur, and the husband
      reprove her, but in a tone so cool and indifferent that she could not
      avoid concluding that his own want of resignation, though not expressed,
      was at heart equal to her own. Each also became somewhat religious, and
      both remarkable for a punctual attendance upon the rites of their church,
      and that in proportion as the love of temporal things overcame them. In
      this manner they lived upwards of thirteen years, when Mrs. Donovan
      declared herself to be in that situation which in due time rendered the
      services of Mary Moan necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the moment this intimation was! given, and its truth confirmed, a
      faint light, not greater than the dim and trembling lustre of a single
      star, broke in upon the darkened affections and worldly spirit of
      Fardorougha Donovan. Had the announcement taken place within a reasonable
      period after his marriage, before he had become sick of disappointment, or
      had surrendered his heart from absolute despair to an incipient spirit of
      avarice, it would no doubt have been hailed with all the eager delight of
      unblighted hope and vivid affection; but now a new and subtle habit had
      been superinduced, after the last cherished expectation of the heart had
      departed; a spirit of foresight and severe calculation descended on him,
      and had so nearly saturated his whole being, that he could not for some
      time actually determine whether the knowledge of his wife&rsquo;s situation was
      more agreeable to his affection, or repugnant to the parsimonious
      disposition which had quickened his heart into an energy incompatible with
      natural benevolence, and the perception of those tender ties which spring
      up from the relations of domestic life. For a considerable time this
      struggle between the two principles went on; sometimes a new hope would
      spring up, attended in the background by a thousand affecting
      circumstances&mdash;on the other hand, some gloomy and undefinable dread
      of exigency, distress, and ruin, would wring his heart and sink his
      spirits down to positive misery. Notwithstanding this conflict between
      growing avarice and affection, the star of the father&rsquo;s love had risen,
      and though, as we have already said, its light was dim and unsteady, yet
      the moment a single opening occurred in the clouded mind, there it was to
      be seen serene and pure, a beautiful emblem of undying and solitary
      affection struggling with the cares and angry passions of life. By
      degrees, however, the husband&rsquo;s heart became touched by the hopes of his
      younger years, former associations revived, and remembrances of past
      tenderness, though blunted in a heart so much changed, came over him like
      the breath of fragrance that has nearly passed away. He began, therefore,
      to contemplate the event without foreboding, and by the time the
      looked-for period arrived, if the world and its debasing influences were
      not utterly overcome, yet nature and the quickening tenderness of a
      father&rsquo;s feeling had made a considerable progress in a heart from which
      they had been long banished. Far different from all this was the history
      of his wife since her perception of an event so delightful. In her was no
      bitter and obstinate principle subversive of affection to be overcome. For
      although she had in latter years sank into the painful apathy of a
      hopeless spirit, and given herself somewhat to the world, yet no sooner
      did the unexpected light dawn upon her, than her whole soul was filled
      with exultation and delight. The world and its influence passed away like
      a dream, and her heart melted into a habit of tenderness at once so novel
      and exquisite, that she often assured her husband she had never felt
      happiness before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such are the respective states of feeling in which our readers find
      Fardorougha Donovan and his wife, upon an occasion whose consequences run
      too far into futurity for us to determine at present whether they are to
      end in happiness or misery. For a considerable time that evening, before
      the arrival of Mary Moan, the males of the family had taken up their
      residence in an inside kiln, where, after having kindled a fire in the
      draught-hole, or what the Scotch call the &ldquo;logie,&rdquo; they sat and chatted in
      that kind of festive spirit which such an event uniformly produces among
      the servants of a family. Fardorougha himself remained for the most part
      with them, that is to say except while ascertaining from time to time the
      situation of his wife. His presence, however, was only a restraint upon
      their good-humor, and his niggardly habits raised some rather
      uncomplimentary epithets during his short visits of inquiry. It is
      customary upon such occasions, as soon as the mistress of the family is
      taken ill, to ask the servants to drink &ldquo;an aisy bout to the misthress,
      sir, an&rsquo; a speedy recovery, not forgettin&rsquo; a safe landin&rsquo; to the
      youngsther, and, like a Christmas compliment, many of them to you both.
      Whoo! death alive, but that&rsquo;s fine stuff. Oh, begorra, the misthress can&rsquo;t
      but thrive wid that in the house. Thank you, sir, an&rsquo; wishin&rsquo; her once
      more safe over her troubles!&mdash;divil a betther misthress ever,&rdquo; etc.,
      etc., etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, however, there was nothing of the kind. Fardorougha&rsquo;s heart, in the
      first instance, was against the expense, and besides, its present
      broodings resembled the throes of pain which break out from the stupor
      that presses so heavily upon the exhausted functions of life in the crisis
      of a severe fever. He could not, in fact, rest nor remain for any length
      of time in the same spot. With a slow but troubled step he walked backward
      and forward, sometimes uttering indistinct ejaculations and broken
      sentences, such as no one could understand. At length he approached his
      own servants, and addressed the messenger whose name was Nogher M&rsquo;Cormick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nogher,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m throubled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throubled! dad, Fardorougha, you ought to be a happy and a thankful man
      this night, that is, if God sinds the misthress safe over it, as I hope He
      will, plase goodness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m poor, Nogher, I&rsquo;m poor, an&rsquo; here&rsquo;s a family comin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, take care it&rsquo;s not sin you&rsquo;re com-mittin&rsquo; by spakin&rsquo; as you&rsquo;re
      doin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know I&rsquo;m poor, Nogher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I know you&rsquo;re <i>not</i>, Fardorougha; but I&rsquo;m afraid, if God hasn&rsquo;t
      said it, your heart&rsquo;s too much fix&rsquo;d upon the world. Be my faix, it&rsquo;s on
      your knees you ought to be this same night, thankin&rsquo; the Almighty for His
      goodness, and not grumblin&rsquo; an&rsquo; sthreelin&rsquo; about the place, flyin&rsquo; in the
      face of God for sendin&rsquo; you an&rsquo; your wife ablessin&rsquo;&mdash;for sure I hear
      the Scripthur says that all childhres a blessin&rsquo; if they&rsquo;re resaved as
      sich; an&rsquo; wo be to the man, says Scripthur, dat&rsquo;s born wid a millstone
      about his neck, especially if he&rsquo;s cast into the say. I know you pray
      enough, but, be my sowl, it hasn&rsquo;t improved your morals, or it&rsquo;s the
      misthress&rsquo; health we&rsquo;d be drinkin&rsquo; in a good bottle o&rsquo; whiskey at the
      present time. Faix, myself wouldn&rsquo;t be much surprised if she had a hard
      twist in consequence, an&rsquo; if she does, the fault&rsquo;s your own an&rsquo; not ours,
      for we&rsquo;re willin&rsquo; as the flowers o&rsquo; May to drink all sorts o&rsquo; good luck to
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nogher,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s truth a great dale of what you&rsquo;ve sed&mdash;maybe
      all of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, I know,&rdquo; returned Nogher, &ldquo;that about the whiskey it&rsquo;s parfit
      gospel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In one thing I&rsquo;ll be advised by you, an&rsquo; that is, I&rsquo;ll go to my knees and
      pray to God to set my heart right if it&rsquo;s wrong. I feel strange&mdash;strange,
      Nogher&mdash;happy, an&rsquo; not happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t go to your knees at all,&rdquo; replied Nogher, &ldquo;if you give us the
      whiskey; or if you do pray, be in earnest, that your heart may be inclined
      to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You desarve none for them words,&rdquo; said Fardorougha, who felt that
      Nogher&rsquo;s buffoonery jarred upon the better feelings that were rising
      within him&mdash;&ldquo;you desarve none, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll get none&mdash;for the
      present at laste, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m only a fool for spaking to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then retired to the upper part of the kiln, where, in a dark corner, he
      knelt with a troubled heart, and prayed to God.
    </p>
    <p>
      We doubt not but such readers as possess feeling will perceive that
      Fardorougha was not only an object at this particular period of much
      interest, but also entitled to sincere sympathy. Few men in his
      circumstances could or probably would so earnestly struggle with a
      predominant passion as he did, though without education, or such a
      knowledge of the world as might enable him, by any observation of the
      human heart in others, to understand the workings in his own. He had not
      been ten minutes at prayer when the voice of his female servant was heard
      in loud and exulting tones, calling out, ere she approached the kiln
      itself&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fardorougha, ca woul thu?&mdash;Where&rsquo;s my footin&rsquo;, masther? Where&rsquo;s my
      arles?&mdash;Come in&mdash;come in, you&rsquo;re a waitin&rsquo; to kiss your son&mdash;the
      misthress is dyin&rsquo; till you kiss our son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last words were uttered as she entered the kiln.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dyin&rsquo;!&rdquo; he repeated&mdash;&ldquo;the misthress dyin&rsquo;&mdash;oh Susy, let a
      thousand childre go before her&mdash;dyin&rsquo;! did you say dyin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay did I, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s truth too; but it&rsquo;s wid joy she&rsquo;s dyin&rsquo; to see you
      kiss one of the purtiest young boys in all the barony of Lisnamona&mdash;myself&rsquo;s
      over head and ears in love wid him already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave a rapid glance upwards, so much so that it was scarcely
      perceptible, and immediately accompanied her into the house. The child, in
      the meantime, had been dressed, and lay on its mother&rsquo;s arm in the bed
      when its father entered. He approached the bedside and glanced at it&mdash;then
      at the mother who lay smiling beside it&mdash;she extended her hand to
      him, whilst the soft, sweet tears of delight ran quietly down her cheeks.
      When he seized her hand he stooped to kiss her, but she put up her other
      hand and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, you must kiss him first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0001" id="linkimage-0001">

    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">
      <img src="images/page191.jpg"
       alt="Page 191-- Imprinted the Father&rsquo;s First Kiss " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      He instantly stooped over the babe, took it in his arms, looked long and
      earnestly upon it, put it up near him, again gave it a long, intense gaze,
      after which he raised its little mouth to his own, and then imprinted the
      father&rsquo;s first kiss upon the fragrant lips of his beloved first-born.
      Having gently deposited the precious babe upon its mother&rsquo;s arm, he caught
      her hand and imprinted upon her lips a kiss;&mdash;but to those who
      understand it, we need not describe it&mdash;to those who cannot, we could
      give no adequate notion of that which we are able in no other way to
      describe than by saying that it would seem as if the condensed enjoyment
      of a whole life were concentrated into that embrace of the child and
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this tender scene was over, the midwife commenced&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if ever a man had raison to be thank&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence, woman!&rdquo; he exclaimed in a voice which hushed her almost into
      terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him alone,&rdquo; said the wife, addressing her, &ldquo;let him alone, I know
      what he feels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;even you, Honora, don&rsquo;t know it&mdash;my heart, my
      heart went astray, and there, undher God and my Saviour, is the being that
      will be the salvation of his father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife understood him and was touched; the tears fell fast from her
      eyes, and, extending her hand to him, she said, as he clasped it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, Fardorougha, the world won&rsquo;t be as much in your heart now, nor your
      temper so dark as it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made no reply; but, placing his other hand over his eyes, he sat in
      that posture for some minutes. On raising his head the tears were running
      as if involuntarily down his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honora,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go out for a little&mdash;you can tell Mary Moan
      where anything&rsquo;s to be had&mdash;let them all be trated so as that they
      don&rsquo;t take too much&mdash;and, Mary Moan, you won&rsquo;t be forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then passed out, and did not appear for upwards of an hour, nor could
      any one of them tell where he had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Honora, after he had left the room, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re now married near
      fourteen years; and until this night I never see him shed a tear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But sure, acushla, if anything can touch a father&rsquo;s heart, the sight of
      his first child will. Now keep yourself aisy, avourneen, and tell me where
      the whiskey an&rsquo; anything else that may be a wantin&rsquo; is, till I give these
      crathurs of sarvints a dhrop of something to comfort thim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this time, however, Mrs. Donovan&rsquo;s mother and two sisters, who had some
      hours previously been sent for, just arrived, a circumstance which once
      more touched the newly awakened chord of the mother&rsquo;s heart, and gave her
      that confidence which the presence of &ldquo;one&rsquo;s own blood,&rdquo; as the people
      expressed it, always communicates upon such occasions. After having kissed
      and admired the babe, and bedewed its face with the warm tears of
      affection, they piously knelt down, as is the custom among most Irish
      families, and offered up a short but fervent prayer of gratitude as well
      for an event so happy, as for her safe delivery, and the future welfare of
      the mother and child. When this was performed, they set themselves to the
      distribution of the blithe meat or groaning malt, a duty which the midwife
      transferred to them with much pleasure, this being a matter which, except
      in matters of necessity, she considered beneath the dignity of her
      profession. The servants were accordingly summoned in due time, and,
      headed by Nogher, soon made their appearance. In events of this nature,
      servants in Ireland, and we believe everywhere else, are always allowed a
      considerable stretch of good-humored license in those observations which
      they are in the habit of making. Indeed, this is not so much an
      extemporaneous indulgence of wit on their part, as a mere repetition of
      the set phrases and traditionary apothegms which have been long
      established among the peasantry, and as they are generally expressive of
      present satisfaction and good wishes for the future, so would it be looked
      upon as churlishness, and in some cases, on the part of the servants, a
      sign of ill-luck, to neglect them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Honora&rsquo;s mother to the servants of both sexes, &ldquo;now, childre,
      that you&rsquo;ve aite a trifle, you must taste something in the way of dhrink.
      It would be too bad on this night above all nights we&rsquo;ve seen yet, not to
      have a glass to the stranger&rsquo;s health at all events. Here, Nogher, thry
      this, avick&mdash;you never got a glass wid a warmer heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nogher took the liquor, his grave face charged with suppressed humor, and
      first looking upon his fellow-servants with a countenance so droll yet
      dry, that none but themselves understood, it, he then directed a very
      sober glance at the good woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;be goxty, sure enough if our hearts
      wouldn&rsquo;t get warm now, they&rsquo;d never warm. A happy night it is for
      Fardorougha and the misthress, at any rate. I&rsquo;ll engage the stranger was
      worth waitin&rsquo; for, too. I&rsquo;ll hould a thrifle, he&rsquo;s the beauty o&rsquo; the world
      this minnit&mdash;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll engage it&rsquo;s breeches we&rsquo;ll have to be I gettin
      for him some o&rsquo; these days, the darlin&rsquo;. Well, here&rsquo;s his health, any way;
      an&rsquo; may he&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Husth, arogorah!&rdquo; exclaimed the mid-wife; &ldquo;stop, I say&mdash;the tree
      afore the fruit, all the world over; don&rsquo;t you know, an&rsquo; bad win to you,
      that if the sthranger was to go to-morrow, as good might come afther him,
      while the paarent stocks are to the fore. The mother an&rsquo; father first,
      acushla, an&rsquo; thin the sthranger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many thanks to you, Mrs. Moan,&rdquo; replied Nogher, &ldquo;for settin&rsquo; me right&mdash;sure
      we&rsquo;ll know something ourselves whin it comes our turn, plase goodness. If
      the misthress isn&rsquo;t asleep, by goxty, I&rsquo;d call in to her, that I&rsquo;m
      dhrinkin&rsquo; her health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not asleep,&rdquo; said her mother; &ldquo;an&rsquo; proud she&rsquo;ll be, poor thing, to
      hear you, Nogher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Misthress!&rdquo; he said in a loud voice, &ldquo;are you asleep, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, Nogher,&rdquo; she replied, in a good-humored tone of voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Nogher, still in a loud voice, and scratching his
      head, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s your health; an&rsquo; now that the ice is bruk&mdash;be goxty,
      an&rsquo; so it is sure,&rdquo; said he in an undertone to the rest&mdash;&ldquo;Peggy,
      behave yourself,&rdquo; he continued, to one of the servant-maids, &ldquo;mockin&rsquo;s
      catchin&rsquo;: faix, you dunna what&rsquo;s afore yourself yet&mdash;beg pardon&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      forgettin&rsquo; myself&mdash;an&rsquo; now that the ice is bruk, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he resumed,
      &ldquo;you must be dacent for the futher. Many a bottle, plase goodness, we&rsquo;ll
      have this way yet. Your health, ma&rsquo;am, an&rsquo; a speedy recovery to you&mdash;an&rsquo; 
      a sudden uprise&mdash;not forgettin&rsquo; the masther&mdash;long life to him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said the midwife, &ldquo;are you forgettin&rsquo; the sthranger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nogher looked her full in the face, and opened his mouth, without saying a
      word, literally pitched the glass of spirits to the very bottom of his
      throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beggin&rsquo; your pardon, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;is it three healths you&rsquo;d have
      me dhrink wid the one glassful?&mdash;not myself, indeed; faix, I&rsquo;d be
      long sorry to make so little of him&mdash;if he was a bit of a <i>girsha</i>
      I&rsquo;d not scruple to give him a corner o&rsquo; the glass, but, bein&rsquo; a young man
      althers the case intirely&mdash;he must have a bumper for himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A girsha!&rdquo; said Peggy, his fellow-servant, feeling the indignity just
      offered to her sex&mdash;&ldquo;Why thin, bad manners to your assurance for that
      same: a girsha&rsquo;s as well intitled to a full glass as a gorsoon, any day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Husth a colleen,&rdquo; said Nogher, good&mdash;humoredly, &ldquo;sure, it&rsquo;s takin&rsquo; 
      pattern by sich a fine example you ought to be. This, Mrs. Moan, is the
      purty crature I was mintionin&rsquo; as we came along, that intends to get
      spanshelled wid myself some o&rsquo; these days&mdash;that is, if she can bring
      me into good-humor, the thief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if it does happen,&rdquo; said Peggy, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have to look sharper afther
      him, Mrs. Moan. He&rsquo;s pleasant enough now, but I&rsquo;ll be bound no man &lsquo;ill
      know betther how to hang his fiddle behind the door when he comes home to
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, acushla, sure he may, if he likes, but if he does, he knows what&rsquo;s
      afore him&mdash;not sayin&rsquo; that he ever will, I hope, for it&rsquo;s a woful
      case whin it comes to that, ahagur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix, it&rsquo;s a happy story for half the poor wives of the parish that
      you&rsquo;re in it,&rdquo; said Peggy, &ldquo;sure, only fore&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Be dhe huath Vread, agus glak sho</i>&mdash;hould your tongue, Peggy,
      and taste this,&rdquo; said the mother of her mistress, handing her a glass: &ldquo;If
      you intend to go together, in the name o&rsquo; goodness fear God more than the
      midwife, if you want to have luck an&rsquo; grace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is it all this?&rdquo; exclaimed the sly girl; &ldquo;faix, it &lsquo;ill make me
      hearty if I dhrink so much&mdash;bedeed it will. Well, misthress, your
      health, an&rsquo; a speedy uprise to you&mdash;an&rsquo; the same to the masther, not
      forgettin&rsquo; the sthranger&mdash;long life an&rsquo; good health to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then put the glass to her lips, and after several small sips,
      appearing to be so many unsuccessful attempts at overcoming her reluctance
      to drink it, she at length took courage, and bolting it down, immediately
      applied her apron to her mouth, making at the same time two or three wry
      faces, gasping, as if to recover the breath which it did not take from
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The midwife, in the mean time, felt that the advice just given to Nogher
      and Peggy contained a clause somewhat more detrimental to her importance
      than was altogether agreeable to her; and to sit calmly under any
      imputation that involved a diminution of her authority, was not within the
      code of her practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they go together,&rdquo; she observed, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s right to fear God, no doubt;
      but that&rsquo;s no raison why they shouldn&rsquo;t pay respect to thim that can sarve
      thim or otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody says aginst that, Mrs. Moan,&rdquo; replied the other; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all fair,
      an&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A midwife&rsquo;s nuttin&rsquo; in your eyes, we suppose,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Moan; &ldquo;but
      maybe&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s thim belongin&rsquo; to you could tell to the contrary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oblaged to you, we suppose, for your sarvices&mdash;an&rsquo; we&rsquo;re not denyin&rsquo; 
      that, aither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For me sarvices&mdash;maybe thim same sarvices wasn&rsquo;t very sweet or
      treaclesome to some o&rsquo; thim,&rdquo; she rejoined, with a mysterious and somewhat
      indignant toss of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said the other in a friendly tone, &ldquo;that makes no maxims one
      way or the other, only dhrink this&mdash;sure we&rsquo;re not goin&rsquo; to quarrel
      about it, any how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid, Honora More! but sure it ud ill become me to hear my own
      corree&mdash;no, no, avourneen,&rdquo; she exclaimed, putting hack the glass; &ldquo;I
      can&rsquo;t take it this&mdash;a&mdash;way; it doesn&rsquo;t agree wid me; you must
      put a grain o&rsquo; shugar an&rsquo; a dhrop o&rsquo; bilin&rsquo; wather to it. It may do very
      well hard for the sarvints, but I&rsquo;m not used to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hird that myself afore,&rdquo; observed Nogher, &ldquo;that she never dhrinks hard
      whiskey. Well, myself never tasted punch but wanst, an&rsquo; be goxty its great
      dhrink. Death alive, Honora More,&rdquo; he continued, in his most insinuating
      manner, &ldquo;make us all a sup. Sure, blood alive, this is not a common night,
      afther what God has sint us: Fardorougha himself would allow you, if he
      was here; deed, be dad, he as good as promised me he would; an&rsquo; you know
      we have the young customer&rsquo;s health to drink yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throth, an&rsquo; you ought,&rdquo; said the mid-wife; &ldquo;the boy says nuttin&rsquo; but the
      thruth&mdash;it&rsquo;s not a common night; an&rsquo; if God has given Fardorougha
      substance, he shouldn&rsquo;t begridge a little, if it was only to show a
      grateful heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Honora More&mdash;which means great Honora, in
      opposition to her daughter, Fardorougha&rsquo;s wife; this being an epithet
      adopted for the purpose of contradistinguishing the members of a family
      when called by the same name&mdash;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s as
      good. My own heart, dear knows, is not in a thrifle, only I have my doubts
      about Fardorougha. However, what&rsquo;s done can&rsquo;t be undone; so, once we mix
      it, he&rsquo;ll be too late to spake if he comes in, any way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The punch was accordingly mixed, and they were in the act of sitting down
      to enjoy themselves with more comfort when Fardorougha entered. As before,
      he was silent and disturbed, neither calm nor stern, but laboring, one
      would suppose, under strong feelings of a decidedly opposite character. On
      seeing the punch made, his brow gathered into something like severity; he
      looked quickly at his mother-in-law, and was about to speak, but, pausing
      a moment, he sat down, and after a little time said in a kind voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s right, it&rsquo;s right&mdash;for his sake, an&rsquo; on his account, have it;
      but, Honora, let there be no waste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure we had to make it for Mrs. Moan whether or not,&rdquo; said his
      mother-in-law, &ldquo;she can&rsquo;t drink it hard, poor woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Moan, who had gone to see her patient, having heard his voice again,
      made her appearance with the child in her arms, and with all the
      importance which such a burden usually bestows upon persons of her
      calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said she, presenting him the infant, &ldquo;take a proper look at this
      fellow. That I may never, if a finer swaddy ever crossed my hands. Throth
      if you wor dead tomorrow he&rsquo;d be mistaken for you&mdash;your born image&mdash;the
      sorra thing else&mdash;eh alanna&mdash;the Lord loves my son&mdash;faix,
      you&rsquo;ve daddy&rsquo;s nose upon you anyhow&mdash;an&rsquo; his chin to a turn. Oh,
      thin, Fardorougha, but there&rsquo;s many a couple rowlin&rsquo; in wealth that &lsquo;ud be
      proud to have the likes of him; an&rsquo; that must die an&rsquo; let it all go to
      strangers, or to them that doesn&rsquo;t care about them, &lsquo;ceptin&rsquo; to get
      grabbin&rsquo; at what they have, that think every day a year that they&rsquo;re above
      the sod. What! manim-an&mdash;kiss your child, man alive. That I may
      never, but he looks at the darlin&rsquo; as if it was a sod of turf. Throth
      you&rsquo;re not worthy of havin&rsquo; such a bully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fardorougha, during this dialogue, held the child in his arms and looked
      upon it earnestly as before, but without betraying any visible indication
      of countenance that could enable a spectator to estimate the nature of
      what passed within him. At length there appeared in his eye a barely
      perceptible expression of benignity, which, however, soon passed away, and
      was replaced by a shadow of gloom and anxiety. Nevertheless, in compliance
      with the commands of the midwife, he kissed its lips, after which the
      servants all gathered round it, each lavishing upon the little urchin
      those hyperbolical expressions of flattery, which, after all, most parents
      are willing to receive as something approximating to gospel truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bedad,&rdquo; said Nogher, &ldquo;that fellow &lsquo;ill be the flower o&rsquo; the Donovans, if
      God spares him&mdash;be goxty, I&rsquo;ll engage he&rsquo;ll give the purty girls many
      a sore heart yet&mdash;he&rsquo;ll play the dickens wid &lsquo;em, or I&rsquo;m not here&mdash;a
      wough! do you hear how the young rogue gives tongue at that? the sorra one
      o&rsquo; the shaver but knows what I&rsquo;m savin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nogher always had an eye to his own comfort, no matter under what
      circumstances he might be placed. Having received the full glass, he
      grasped his master&rsquo;s hand, and in the usual set phrases, to which,
      however, was added much extempore matter of his own, he drank the baby&rsquo;s
      health, congratulating the parents, in his own blunt way, upon this
      accession to their happiness. The other servants continued to pour out
      their praises in terms of delight and astonishment at his accomplishments
      and beauty, each, in imitation of Nogher, concluding with a toast in
      nearly the same words.
    </p>
    <p>
      How sweet from all other lips is the praise of those we love! Fardorougha,
      who, a moment before, looked upon his infant&rsquo;s face with an unmoved
      countenance, felt incapable of withstanding the flattery of his own
      servants when uttered in favor of the child. His eye became complacent,
      and while Nogher held his hand, a slight pressure in return was proof
      sufficient that his heart beat in accordance with the hopes they expressed
      of all that the undeveloped future might bestow upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When their little treat was over, the servants withdrew for the night, and
      Fardorougha himself, still laboring under an excitement so complicated and
      novel, retired rather to shape his mind to some definite tone of feeling
      than to seek repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      How strange is life, and how mysteriously connected is the woe or the weal
      of a single family with the great mass of human society! We beg the reader
      to stand with us upon a low, sloping hill, a little to the left of
      Fardorougha&rsquo;s house, and, after having solemnized his heart by a glance at
      the starry gospel of the skies, to cast his eye upon the long,
      white-washed dwelling, as it shines faintly in the visionary distance of a
      moonlight night. How full of tranquil beauty is the hour, and how deep the
      silence, except when it is broken by the loud baying of the watch-dog, as
      he barks in sullen fierceness at his own echo! Or perhaps there is nothing
      heard but the sugh of the mountain river, as with booming sound it rises
      and falls in the distance, filling the ear of midnight with its wild and
      continuous melody. Look around, and observe the spirit of repose which
      sleeps on the face of nature; think upon the dream of human life, and of
      all the inexplicable wonders which are read from day to day in that
      miraculous page&mdash;the heart of man. Neither your eye nor imagination
      need pass beyond that humble roof before you, in which it is easy to
      perceive, by the lights passing at this unusual hour across the windows,
      that there is something added either to their joy or to their sorrow.
      There is the mother, in whose heart was accumulated the unwasted
      tenderness of years, forgetting all the past in the first intoxicating
      influence of an unknown ecstasy, and looking to the future with the eager
      aspirations of affection. There is the husband, too, for whose heart the
      lank devil of the avaricious&mdash;the famine-struck god of the miser&mdash;is
      even now contending with the almost extinguished love which springs up in
      a father&rsquo;s bosom on the sight of his first-born.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reader, who can tell whether the entrancing visions of the happy mother,
      or the gloomy anticipations of her apprehensive husband, are most
      prophetic of the destiny which is before their child. Many indeed and
      various are the hopes and fears felt under that roof, and deeply will
      their lights and shadows be blended in the life of the being whose claims
      are so strong upon their love. There, for some time past the lights in the
      window have appeared less frequently&mdash;one by one we presume the
      inmates have gone to repose&mdash;no other is now visible&mdash;the last
      candle is extinguished, and this humble section of the great family of man
      is now at rest with the veil of a dark and fearful future unlifted before
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is not perhaps in the series of human passions any one so difficult
      to be eradicated out of the bosom as avarice, no matter with what seeming
      moderation it puts itself forth, or under what disguise it may appear. And
      among all its cold-blooded characteristics there is none so utterly
      unaccountable as that frightful dread of famine and ultimate starvation,
      which is also strong in proportion to the impossibility of its ever being
      realized. Indeed, when it arrives to this we should not term it a passion,
      but a malady, and in our opinion the narrow-hearted patient should be
      prudently separated from society, and treated as one laboring under an
      incurable species of monomania.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the few days that intervened between our hero&rsquo;s birth and his
      christening, Fardorougha&rsquo;s mind was engaged in forming some fixed
      principle by which to guide his heart in the conflict that still went on
      between avarice and affection. In this task he imagined that the father
      predominated over the miser almost without a struggle; whereas, the fact
      was, that the subtle passion, ever more ingenious than the simple one,
      changed its external character, and came out in the shape of affectionate
      forecast and provident regard for the wants and prospects of his child.
      This gross deception of his own heart he felt as a relief; for, though
      smitten with the world, it did not escape him that the birth of his little
      one, all its circumstances considered, ought to have caused him to feel an
      enjoyment unalloyed by the care and regret which checked his sympathies as
      a parent. Neither was conscience itself altogether silent, nor the blunt
      remonstrances of his servants wholly without effect. Nay, so completely
      was his judgment overreached that he himself attributed this anomalous
      state of feeling to a virtuous effort of Christian duty, and looked upon
      the encroachments which a desire of saving wealth had made on his heart as
      a manifest proof of much parental attachment. He consequently loved his
      wealth through the medium of his son, and laid it down as a fixed
      principle that every act of parsimony on his part was merely one of
      prudence, and had the love of a father and an affectionate consideration
      for his child&rsquo;s future welfare to justify it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first striking instance of this close and griping spirit appeared upon
      an occasion which seldom fails to open, in Ireland at least, all the warm
      and generous impulses of our mature. When his wife deemed it necessary to
      make those hospitable preparations for their child&rsquo;s christening, which
      are so usual in the country, he treated her intention of complying with
      this old custom as a direct proof&mdash;of unjustifiable folly and
      extravagance&mdash;nay, his remonstrance with her exhibited such
      remarkable good sense and prudence, that it was a matter of extreme
      difficulty to controvert it, or to perceive that it originated from any
      other motive than a strong interest in the true welfare of their child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will our wasting meat and money, an&rsquo; for that matthur health and time, on
      his christenin&rsquo;, aither give him more health or make us love him betther?
      It&rsquo;s not the first time; Honora, that I&rsquo;ve heard yourself make little of
      some of our nabors for goin&rsquo; beyant their ability in gettin&rsquo; up big
      christenins. Don&rsquo;t be foolish now thin when it comes to your own turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wife took the babe up, and, after having gazed affectionately on its
      innocent features, replied to him, in a voice of tenderness and reproof&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows, Fardorougha, an&rsquo; if I do act wid folly, as you call it, in
      gettin&rsquo; ready his christenin&rsquo;, surely, surely you oughtn&rsquo;t to blame the
      mother for that. Little I thought, acushla oge, that your own father &lsquo;ud
      begrudge you as good a christenin&rsquo; as is put over any other nabor&rsquo;s child.
      I&rsquo;m afraid, Fardorougha, he&rsquo;s not as much in your heart as he ought to
      be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad proof of love for him, Honora, to put to the bad what may an&rsquo; 
      would be serviceable to him hereafter. You only think for the present; but
      I can&rsquo;t forget that he&rsquo;s to be settled in the world, an&rsquo; you know yourself
      what poor means we have o&rsquo; doin&rsquo; that, an&rsquo; that if we begin to be
      extravagant an&rsquo; wasteful, bekase God has sent him, we may beg wid him
      afore long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no danger of us beggin&rsquo; wid him. No,&rdquo; she continued, the pride of
      the mother having been touched, &ldquo;my boy will never beg&mdash;no, avourneen&mdash;you
      never will&mdash;nor shame or disgrace will never come upon him aither.
      Have you no trust in God, Fardorougha?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God never helps them that neglect themselves, Honora.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if it was plasing to His will to remove him from us, would you ever
      forgive yourself not lettin&rsquo; him have a christenin&rsquo; like another child?&rdquo;
       rejoined the persevering mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The priest,&rdquo; replied the good man, &ldquo;will do as much for the poor child as
      the rich; there&rsquo;s but one sacrament for both; anything else is waste, as I
      said, an&rsquo; I won&rsquo;t give in to it. You don&rsquo;t considher that your way of it
      &lsquo;ud spend as much in one day as &lsquo;ud clothe him two or three years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I never sin this day, Fardorougha, but one &lsquo;ud think you&rsquo;re tired of
      him already. By not givin&rsquo; in to what&rsquo;s dacent you know you&rsquo;ll only fret
      me&mdash;a thing that no man wid half a heart &lsquo;ud do to any woman
      supportin&rsquo; a babby as I am. A fretted nurse makes a child sick, as Molly
      Moan tould you before she went; so that it&rsquo;s not on my own account I&rsquo;m
      spakin&rsquo;, but on his&mdash;poor, weeny pet&mdash;the Lord love him! Look at
      his innocent purty little face, an&rsquo; how can you have the heart,
      Fardorougha? Come, avourneen, give way to me this wanst; throth, if you
      do, you&rsquo;ll see how I&rsquo;ll nurse him, an&rsquo; what a darlin&rsquo; lump o&rsquo; sugar I&rsquo;ll
      have him for you in no time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused a little at this delicate and affecting appeal of the mother;
      but, except by a quick glance that passed from her to their child, it was
      impossible to say whether or not it made any impression on his heart, or
      in the slightest degree changed his resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let me alone now. I&rsquo;ll think of it. I&rsquo;ll turn it
      over an&rsquo; see what&rsquo;s best to be done; do you the same, Honora, an&rsquo; may be
      your own sinse will bring you to my side of the question at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day, his wife renewed the subject with unabated anxiety; but,
      instead of expressing any change in her favor, Fardorougha declined even
      to enter into it at all. An evasive reply was all she could extract from
      him, with an assurance that he would in a day or two communicate the
      resolution to which he had finally come. She perceived, at once, that the
      case was hopeless, and, after one last ineffectual attempt to bring him
      round, she felt herself forced to abandon it. The child, therefore, much
      to the mother&rsquo;s mortification, was baptized without a christening, unless
      the mere presence of the godfather and godmother, in addition to
      Fardorougha&rsquo;s own family, could be said to constitute one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our readers, perhaps, are not aware that a cause of deep anxiety, hitherto
      unnoticed by us, operated with latent power upon Fardorougha&rsquo;s heart. But
      so strong in Ireland is the beautiful superstition&mdash;if it can with
      truth be termed so&mdash;that children are a blessing only when received
      as such, that, even though supported by the hardest and most shameless of
      all vices, avarice, Fardorougha had not nerve to avow this most unnatural
      source for his distress. The fact, however, was, that, to a mind so
      constituted, the apprehension of a large family was in itself a
      consideration, which he thought might, at a future period of their lives,
      reduce both him and his to starvation and death. Our readers may remember
      Nogher M&rsquo;Cormick&rsquo;s rebuke to him, when he heard Fardorougha allude to
      this; and so accessible was he then to the feeling, that, on finding his
      heart at variance with it, he absolutely admitted his error, and prayed to
      God that he might be enabled to overcome it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, therefore, on the day after the baptism of young Connor, for so
      had the child been called after his paternal grandfather, that, as a
      justification for his own conduct in the matter of the christening, he
      disclosed to his wife, with much reluctance and embarrassment, this
      undivulged source of his fears for the future, alleging it as a just
      argument for his declining to be guided by her opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The indignant sympathies of the mother abashed, on this occasion, the
      miserable and calculating impiety of the husband; her reproaches were open
      and unshrinking, and her moral sense of his conduct just and beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fardorougha,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I thought, up to this time, to this day, that
      there was nothing in your heart but too much of the world; but now I&rsquo;m
      afeard, if God hasn&rsquo;t sed it, that the devil himself&rsquo;s there. You&rsquo;re
      frettin&rsquo; for &lsquo;fraid of a family; but has God sent us any but this one yet?
      No&mdash;an&rsquo; I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised, if the Almighty should punish your
      guilty heart, by making the child he gave you, a curse, instead of a
      blessin&rsquo;. I think, as it is, he has brought little pleasure to you for so
      far, and, if your heart hardens as he grows up, it&rsquo;s more unhappy you&rsquo;ll
      get every day you live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very fine talk, Honora; but to people in our condition, I can&rsquo;t
      see any very great blessin&rsquo; in a houseful of childre. If we&rsquo;re able to
      provide for this one, we&rsquo;ll have raison to be thankful widout wishin&rsquo; for
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my opinion, Fardorougha, you don&rsquo;t love the child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Change that opinion, then, Honora; I do love the child; but there&rsquo;s no
      needcessity for blowin it about to every one I meet. If I didn&rsquo;t love him,
      I wouldn&rsquo;t feel as I do about all the hardships that may be before him.
      Think of what a bad sason, or a failure of the craps, might bring us all
      to. God grant that we mayn&rsquo;t come to the bag and staff before he&rsquo;s settled
      in the world at all, poor thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well, Fardorougha; you may make yourself as unhappy as you like;
      for me, I&rsquo;ll put my trust in the Saviour of the world for my child. If you
      can trust in any one better than God, do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honora, there&rsquo;s no use in this talk&mdash;it&rsquo;ll do nothing aither for him
      or us&mdash;besides, I have no more time to discoorse about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then left her; but, as she viewed his dark, inflexible features ere he
      went, an oppressive sense of something not far removed from affliction
      weighed her down. The child had been asleep in her arms during the
      foregoing dialogue, and, after his father had departed, she placed him in
      the cradle, and, throwing the corner of her blue apron over her shoulder,
      she rocked him into a sounder sleep, swaying herself at the same time to
      and fro, with that inward sorrow, of which, among the lower classes of
      Irish females, this motion is uniformly expressive. It is not to be
      supposed, however, that, as the early graces of childhood gradually
      expanded (as they did) into more than ordinary beauty, the avarice of the
      father was not occasionally encountered in its progress by! sudden gushes
      of love for his son. It was impossible for any parent, no matter how
      strongly strongly the hideous idol of mammon might sway his heart, to look
      upon a creature so fair and beautiful, without being frequently touched
      into something like affection. The fact was, that, as the child advanced
      towards youth, the two principles we are describing nearly kept pace one
      with the other. That the bad and formidable passion made rapid strides,
      must be admitted, but that it engrossed the whole spirit of the father, is
      not true. The mind and gentle character of the boy&mdash;his affectionate
      disposition, and the extraordinary advantages of his person&mdash;could
      not fail sometimes to surprise his father into sudden bursts of affection.
      But these, when they occurred, were looked upon by Fardorougha as so many
      proofs that he still entertained for the boy love sufficient to justify a
      more intense desire of accumulating wealth for his sake. Indeed, ere the
      lad had numbered thirteen summers, Fardorougha&rsquo;s character as a miser had
      not only gone far abroad throughout the neighborhood, but was felt, by the
      members of his own family, with almost merciless severity. From habits of
      honesty, and a decent sense of independence, he was now degraded to
      rapacity and meanness; what had been prudence, by degrees degenerated into
      cunning; and he who, when commencing life, was looked upon only as a
      saving man, had now become notorious for extortion and usury.
    </p>
    <p>
      A character such as this, among a people of generous and lively feeling
      like the Irish, is in every state of life the object of intense and
      undisguised abhorrence. It was with difficulty he could succeed in
      engaging servants, either for domestic or agricultural purposes, and,
      perhaps, no consideration, except the general kindness which was felt for
      his wife and son, would have induced any person whatsoever to enter into
      his employment. Honora and Connor did what in them lay to make the
      dependents of the family experience as little of Fardorougha&rsquo;s griping
      tyranny as possible. Yet, with all their kind-hearted ingenuity and secret
      bounty, they were scarcely able to render their situation barely
      tolerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be difficult to find any language, no matter what pen might wield
      it, capable of portraying the love which Honora Donovan bore to her
      gentle, her beautiful, and her only son. Ah! there in that last epithet,
      lay the charm which wrapped her soul in him, and in all that related to
      his welfare. The moment she saw it was not the will of God to bless them
      with other offspring, her heart gathered about him with a jealous
      tenderness which trembled into agony at the idea of his loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her love for him, then, multiplied itself into many hues, for he was in
      truth the prism, on which, when it fell, all the varied beauty of its
      colors became visible. Her heart gave not forth the music of a single
      instrument, but breathed the concord of sweet sounds, as heard from the
      blended melody of many. Fearfully different from this were the feelings of
      Fardorougha, on finding that he was to be the first and the last
      vouchsafed to their union. A single regret, however, scarcely felt,
      touched even him, when he reflected that if Connor were to be removed from
      them, their hearth must become desolate. But then came the fictitious
      conscience, with its nefarious calculations, to prove that, in their
      present circumstances, the dispensation which withheld others was a
      blessing to him that was given. Even Connor himself, argued the miser,
      will be the gainer by it, for what would my five loaves and three fishes
      be among so many? The pleasure, however, that is derived from the
      violation of natural affection is never either full or satisfactory. The
      gratification felt by Fardorougha, upon reflecting that no further
      addition was to be made to their family, resembled that which a hungry man
      feels who dreams he is partaking of a luxurious banquet. Avarice, it is
      true, like fancy, was gratified, but the enjoyment, though rich to that
      particular passion, left behind it a sense of unconscious remorse, which
      gnawed his heart with a slow and heavy pain, that operated like a
      smothered fire, wasting what it preys upon, in secrecy and darkness. In
      plainer terms, he was not happy, but so absorbed in the ruling passion&mdash;the
      pursuit of wealth&mdash;that he felt afraid to analyze his anxiety, or to
      trace to its true source the cause of his own misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time, his boy grew up the pride and ornament of the parish,
      idolized by his mother, and beloved by all who knew him. Limited and
      scanty was the education which his father could be prevailed upon to
      bestow upon him; but there was nothing that could deprive him of his
      natural good sense, nor of the affections which his mother&rsquo;s love had
      drawn out and cultivated. One thing was remarkable in him, which we
      mention with reluctance, as it places his father&rsquo;s character in a
      frightful point of view; it is this, that his love for that father was
      such as is rarely witnessed, even in the purest and most affectionate
      circles of domestic life. But let not our readers infer, either from what
      we have written, or from any thing we may write, that Fardorougha hated
      this lovely and delightful boy; on the contrary, earth contained not an
      object, except his money, which he loved so well. His affection for him,
      however, was only such as could proceed from the dregs of a defiled and
      perverted heart. This is not saying much, but it is saying all. What in
      him was parental attachment, would in another man, to such a son, be
      unfeeling and detestable indifference. His heart sank on contemplating the
      pittance he allowed for Connor&rsquo;s education; and no remonstrance could
      prevail on him to clothe the boy with common decency. Pocket-money was out
      of the question, as were all those considerate indulgences to youth, that
      blunt, when timely afforded, the edge of early anxiety to know those
      amusements of life, which, if not innocently gratified before passion gets
      strong, are apt to produce, at a later period, that giddy intoxication,
      which has been the destruction of thousands. When Connor, however, grew
      up, and began to think for himself, he could not help feeling that, from a
      man so absolutely devoted to wealth as his father was, to receive even the
      slenderest proof of affection, was in this case no common manifestation of
      the attachment he bore him. There was still a higher and nobler motive. He
      could not close his ears to the character which had gone abroad of his
      father, and from that principle of generosity, which induces a man, even
      when ignorant of the quarrel, to take the weaker side, he fought his
      battles, until, in the end, he began to believe them just. But the most
      obvious cause of the son&rsquo;s attachment we have not mentioned, and it is
      useless to travel into vain disquisitions, for that truth which may be
      found in the instinctive impulses of nature. He was Connor&rsquo;s father, and
      though penurious in everything that regarded even his son&rsquo;s common
      comfort, he had never uttered a harsh word to him during his life, or
      denied him any gratification which could be had without money. Nay, a kind
      word, or a kind glance, from Fardorougha, fired the son&rsquo;s resentment
      against the world which traduced him; for how could it be otherwise, when
      the habitual defence made by him, when arraigned for his penury, was an
      anxiety to provide for the future welfare and independence of his son?
    </p>
    <p>
      Many characters in life appear difficult to be understood, but if those
      who wish to analyze them only consulted human nature, instead of rushing
      into far-fetched theories, and traced with patience the effect which
      interest, or habit, or inclination is apt to produce on men of a peculiar
      temperament, when placed in certain situations, there would be much less
      difficulty in avoiding those preposterous exhibitions which run into
      caricature, or outrage the wildest combinations that can be formed from
      the common elements of humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having said this much, we will beg our readers to suppose that young
      Connor is now twenty-two years of age, and request them, besides, to
      prepare for the gloom which is about to overshadow our story.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have already stated that Fardorougha was not only an extortioner, but a
      usurer. Now, as some of our readers may be surprised that a man in his
      station of life could practise usury or even extortion to any considerable
      extent, we feel it necessary to inform them that there exists among Irish
      farmers a class of men who stand, with respect to the surrounding poor and
      improvident, in a position precisely analogous to that which is occupied
      by a Jew or moneylender among those in the higher classes who borrow, and
      are extravagant upon a larger scale. If, for instance, a struggling small
      farmer have to do with a needy landlord or an unfeeling agent, who
      threatens to seize or eject, if the rent be not paid to the day, perhaps
      this small farmer is forced to borrow from one of those rustic Jews the
      full amount of the gale; for this he gives him, at a valuation dictated by
      the lender&rsquo;s avarice and his own distress, the oats, or potatoes, or hay,
      which he is not able to dispose of in sufficient time to meet the demand
      that is upon him. This property, the miser draws home, and stacks or
      houses it until the markets are high, when he disposes of it at a price
      which often secures for him a profit amounting to one-third, and
      occasionally one-half, above the sum lent, upon which, in the meantime,
      interest is accumulating. For instance, if the accommodation be twenty
      pounds, property to that amount at a ruinous valuation is brought home by
      the accommodator. This perhaps sells for thirty, thirty-five, or forty
      pounds, so that, deducting the labor of preparing it for market, there is
      a gain of fifty, seventy-five, or a hundred per cent. besides, probably,
      ten per cent, interest, which is altogether distinct from the former. This
      class of persons will also take a joint bond, or joint promissory note,
      or, in fact, any collateral security they know to be valid, and if the
      contract be not fulfilled, they immediately pounce upon the guarantee.
      They will, in fact, as a mark of their anxiety to assist a neighbor in
      distress, receive a pig from a widow, or a cow from a struggling small
      farmer, at thirty or forty per cent, beneath its value, and claim the
      merit of being a friend into the bargain. Such men are bitter enemies to
      paper money, especially to notes issued by private bankers, which they
      never take in payment. It is amusing, if a person could forget the
      distress which occasions the scene, to observe one of these men producing
      an old stocking, or a long black leathern purse&mdash;or a calf-skin
      pocket-book with the hair on, and counting down, as if he gave out his
      heart&rsquo;s blood drop by drop, the specific sum, uttering, at the same time,
      a most lugubrious history of his own poverty, and assuring the poor wretch
      he is fleecing, that if he (the miser) gives way to his good nature, he
      must ultimately become the victim of his own benevolence. In no case,
      however, do they ever put more in the purse or stocking than is just then
      wanted, and sometimes they will be short a guinea or ten shillings, which
      they borrow from a neighbor, or remit to the unfortunate dupe in the
      course of the day. This they do in order to enhance the obligation, and
      give a distinct proof of their poverty. Let not, therefore, the gentlemen
      of the Minories, nor our P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;s and our M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;s
      nearer home, imagine for a moment that they engross the spirit of rapacity
      and extortion to themselves. To the credit of the class, however, to which
      they belong, such persons are not so numerous as formerly, and to the
      still greater honor of the peasantry be it said, the devil himself is not
      hated with half the detestation which is borne them. In order that the
      reader may understand our motive for introducing such a description as
      that we have now given, it will be necessary for us to request him to
      accompany a stout, well-set young man, named Bartle Flanagan, along a
      green ditch, which, planted with osiers, leads to a small meadow belonging
      to Fardorougha Donovan. In this meadow, his son Connor is now making hay,
      and on seeing Flanagan approach, he rests upon the top of his rake, and
      exclaims in a soliloquy:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God help you and yours, Bartle! If it was in my power, I take God to
      witness, I&rsquo;d make up wid a willin&rsquo; heart for all the hardship and
      misfortune my father brought upon you all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then resumed his labor, in order that the meeting between him and
      Bartle might take place with less embarrassment, for he saw at once that
      the former was about to speak to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the weather too hot, Connor, to work bareheaded? I think you ought
      to keep on your hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bartle, how are you?&mdash;off or on, it&rsquo;s the same thing; hat or no hat,
      it&rsquo;s broilin&rsquo; weather, the Lord be praised! What news, Bartle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much, Connor, but what you know&mdash;a family that was strugglin&rsquo;,
      but honest, brought to dissolation. We&rsquo;re broken up; my father and
      mother&rsquo;s both livin&rsquo; in a cabin they tuck from Billy Nuthy; Mary and
      Alick&rsquo;s gone to sarvice, and myself&rsquo;s just on my way to hire wid the last
      man I ought to go to&mdash;your father, that is, supposin&rsquo; we can agree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As heaven&rsquo;s above me, Bartle, there&rsquo;s not a man in the county this day
      sorrier for what has happened than myself! But the truth is, that when my
      father heard of Tom Grehan, that was your security, havin&rsquo; gone to
      America, he thought every day a month till the note was due. My mother an&rsquo; 
      I did all we could, but you know his temper; &lsquo;twas no use. God knows, as I
      said before, I&rsquo;m heart sorry for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one knows, Connor, that if your mother an&rsquo; you had your way an&rsquo; 
      will, your father wouldn&rsquo;t be sich a screw as he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the meantime, don&rsquo;t forget that he is my father, Bartle, an&rsquo; above all
      things, remimber that I&rsquo;ll allow no man to speak disparagingly of him in
      my presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;ll allow, Connor, that he was a scourge an&rsquo; a curse to us,
      an&rsquo; that none of us ought to like a bone in his skin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t be expected you would, Bartle; but you must grant, after all,
      that he was only recoverin&rsquo; his own. Still, when you know what my feeling
      is upon the business, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s generous in you to bring it up
      between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could bear his harrishin&rsquo; us out of house an&rsquo; home,&rdquo; proceeded the
      other, &ldquo;only for one thought that still crasses in an me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that, Bartle?&mdash;God knows I can&rsquo;t help feelin&rsquo; for you,&rdquo; he
      added, smote with the desolation which his father had brought upon the
      family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He lent us forty pounds,&rdquo; proceeded the young man; &ldquo;and when he found
      that Tom Grehan, our security, went to America, he came down upon us the
      minute the note was due, canted all we had at half price, and turned us to
      starve upon the world; now, I could bear that, but there&rsquo;s one thing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s twice you spoke about that one thing,&rdquo; said Connor, somewhat
      sharply, for he felt hurt at the obstinacy of the other, in continuing a
      subject so distressing to him; &ldquo;but,&rdquo; he continued, in a milder tone,
      &ldquo;tell me, Bartle, for goodness&rsquo; sake, what it is, an&rsquo; let us put an&rsquo; end
      to the discoorse. I&rsquo;m sure it must be unpleasant to both of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t signify,&rdquo; replied the young man, in a desponding voice&mdash;&ldquo;she&rsquo;s
      gone; it&rsquo;s all over wid me there; I&rsquo;m a beggar&mdash;I&rsquo;m a beggar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bartle,&rdquo; said Connor, taking his hand, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re too much downhearted; come
      to us, but first go to my father; I know you&rsquo;ll find it hard to deal with
      him. Never mind that; whatever he offers you, close wid him, an&rsquo; take my
      word for it that my mother and I between us will make you up dacent wages;
      an&rsquo; sorry I am that it&rsquo;s come to this wid you, poor fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bartle&rsquo;s cheek grew pale as ashes; he wrung Connor&rsquo;s hand with all his
      force, and fixed an unshrinking eye on him as he replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you Connor, now&mdash;but I hope I&rsquo;ll live to thank you better yet,
      and if I do, you needn&rsquo;t thank me for any return I may make you or yours.
      I will close wid your father, an&rsquo; take whatsomever he&rsquo;ll order me; for,
      Connor,&rdquo; and he wrung his hand again&mdash;&ldquo;Connor O&rsquo;Donovan, I haven&rsquo;t a
      house or home this day, nor a place under God&rsquo;s canopy where to lay my
      head, except upon the damp floor of my father&rsquo;s naked cabin. Think of
      that, Connor, an&rsquo; think if I can forget it; still,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll see,
      Connor&mdash;Connor, you&rsquo;ll see how I&rsquo;ll forgive it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a credit to yourself to spake as you do,&rdquo; replied Connor; &ldquo;call this
      way, an&rsquo; let me know what&rsquo;s done, an&rsquo; I hope, Bartle, you an&rsquo; I will have
      some pleasant days together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, an&rsquo; pleasant nights, too, I hope,&rdquo; replied the other: &ldquo;to be sure
      I&rsquo;ll call; but if you take my advice, you&rsquo;d tie a handkerchy about your
      head; it&rsquo;s mad hot, an&rsquo; enough to give one a fever bareheaded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having made this last observation, he loaped across a small drain that
      bounded the meadow, and proceeded up the fields to Fardorougha&rsquo;s house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bartle Flanagan was a young man, about five feet six in height, but of a
      remarkably compact and athletic form. His complexion was dark, but his
      countenance open, and his features well set and regular. Indeed his whole
      appearance might be termed bland and prepossessing. If he ever appeared to
      disadvantage it was whilst under the influence of resentment, during which
      his face became pale as death, nay, almost livid; and, as his brows were
      strong and black, the contrast between them and his complexion changed the
      whole expression of his countenance into that of a person whose enmity a
      prudent man would avoid. He was not quarrelsome, however, nor subject to
      any impetuous bursts of passion; his resentments, if he retained any, were
      either dead or silent, or, at all events, so well regulated that his
      acquaintances looked upon him as a young fellow of a good-humored and
      friendly disposition. It is true, a hint had gone abroad that on one or
      two occasions he was found deficient in courage; but, as the circumstances
      referred to were rather unimportant, his conduct by many was attributed
      rather to good sense and a disinclination to quarrel on frivolous grounds,
      than to positive cowardice. Such he was, and such he is, now that he has
      entered upon the humble drama of our story.
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving at Fardorougha&rsquo;s house, he found that worthy man at dinner,
      upon a cold bone of bacon and potatoes. He had only a few moments before
      returned from the residence of the County Treasurer, with whom he went to
      lodge, among other sums, that which was so iniquitously wrung from the
      ruin of the Flanagans. It would be wrong to say that he felt in any degree
      embarrassed on looking into the face of one whom he had so oppressively
      injured. The recovery of his usurious debts, no matter how merciless the
      process, he considered only as an act of justice to himself, for his
      conscience having long ago outgrown the perception of his own inhumanity,
      now only felt compunction when death or the occasional insolvency of a
      security defeated his rapacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Bartle entered, Fardorougha and he surveyed each other with perfect
      coolness for nearly half a minute, during which time neither uttered a
      word. The silence was first broken by Honora, who put forward a chair, and
      asked Flanagan to sit down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Bartle,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;sit down, boy; an&rsquo; how is all the family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Deed, can&rsquo;t complain,&rdquo; replied Bartle, &ldquo;as time goes; an&rsquo; how are you,
      Fardorougha? although I needn&rsquo;t ax&mdash;you re takin&rsquo; care of number one,
      any how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m middlin&rsquo;, Bartle, middlin&rsquo;; as well as a man can be that has his
      heart broke every day in the year strivin&rsquo; to come by his own, an&rsquo; can&rsquo;t
      do it; but I&rsquo;m a fool, an&rsquo; ever was&mdash;sarvin&rsquo; others an&rsquo; ruinin&rsquo; 
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bartle,&rdquo; said Mrs. Donovan, &ldquo;are you unwell, dear? you look as pale as
      death. Let me get you a drink of fresh milk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s weak,&rdquo; said Fardorougha, &ldquo;an&rsquo; he looks weak, a drink of fresh
      wather &lsquo;ud be betther for him; ever an&rsquo; always a drink of wather for a
      weak man, or a weak woman aither; it recovers them sooner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, kindly, Mrs. Donovan, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m obliged to you, Fardorougha, for
      the wather; but I&rsquo;m not a bit weak; it&rsquo;s only the heat o&rsquo; the day ails me&mdash;for
      sure enough it&rsquo;s broilin&rsquo; weather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Deed it is,&rdquo; replied Honora, &ldquo;kill in&rsquo; weather to them that has to be
      out undher it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s good for nothin&rsquo; else, it&rsquo;s good for, the hay&mdash;makin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
       observed Fardorougha.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tould, Misther Donovan,&rdquo; said Bartle, &ldquo;that&rsquo; you want a sarvint man:
      now, if you do, I want a place, an&rsquo; you see I&rsquo;m comin&rsquo; to you to look for
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven above, Bartle!&rdquo; exclaimed Honora, &ldquo;what do you mean? Is it one of
      Dan Flanagan&rsquo;s sons goin&rsquo; to sarvice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one, but all of them,&rdquo; replied the other, coolly, &ldquo;an&rsquo; his daughters,
      too, Mrs. Donovan; but it&rsquo;s all the way o! the world. If Mr. Donovan &lsquo;ll
      hire me I&rsquo;ll thank him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be Mistherin&rsquo; me, Bartle; Misther them that has means an&rsquo; 
      substance,&rdquo; returned Donovan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, God forgive you, Fardorougha!&rdquo; exclaimed his honest and humane wife.
      &ldquo;God forgive you! Bartle, from my heart, from the core o&rsquo; my heart, I pity
      you, my poor boy. An&rsquo; is it to this, Fardorougha, you&rsquo;ve brought them&mdash;Oh,
      Saviour o&rsquo; the world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She fixed her eyes upon the victim of her husband&rsquo;s extortion, and in an
      instant they were filled with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I do,&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;but strive to recover my own? How could
      I afford to lose forty pounds? An&rsquo; I was tould for sartin that your father
      knew Grehan was goin&rsquo; to Ameriky when he got him to go security. Whisht,
      Honora, you&rsquo;re as foolish a woman as riz this day; haven&rsquo;t you your sins
      to cry for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows I have, Fardorougha, an&rsquo; more than my own to cry for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say you did hear as much,&rdquo; said Bartle, quietly replying to the
      observation of Fardorougha respecting his father; &ldquo;but you know it&rsquo;s a
      folly to talk about spilt milk. If you want a sarvint I&rsquo;ll hire; for, as I
      said a while ago, I want a place, an&rsquo; except wid you I don&rsquo;t know where to
      get one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you come to me,&rdquo; observed the other, &ldquo;you must go to your duty, an&rsquo; 
      observe the fast days, but not the holydays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sarvints isn&rsquo;t obliged to obsarve them,&rdquo; replied Bartle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I always put it in the bargain,&rdquo; returned the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to that,&rdquo; said Bartle, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t much mind it. Sure it&rsquo;ll be for the
      good o&rsquo; my sowl, any way. But what wages will you be givin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty shillings every half year;&mdash;that&rsquo;s three pounds&mdash;sixty
      shillings a year. A great deal o&rsquo; money. I&rsquo;m sure I dunna where it&rsquo;s to
      come from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very little for a year&rsquo;s hard labor,&rdquo; replied Bartle, &ldquo;but little as
      it is, Fardorougha, owin&rsquo; to what has happened betwixt us, believe me, I&rsquo;m
      right glad to take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but Bartle, you know there&rsquo;s fifteen shillins of the ould account
      still due, and you must allow it out o&rsquo; your wages; if you don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s no
      bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bartle&rsquo;s face became livid; but he was perfectly cool;&mdash;indeed, so
      much so that he smiled at this last condition of Fardorougha. It was a
      smile, however, at once so ghastly, dark, and frightful, that, by any
      person capable of tracing the secret workings of some deadly passion on
      the countenance, its purport could not have been mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows, Fardorougha, you might let that pass&mdash;considher that
      you&rsquo;ve been hard enough upon us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows I say the same,&rdquo; observed Honora. &ldquo;Is it the last drop o&rsquo; the
      heart&rsquo;s blood you want to squeeze out, Fardorougha?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last drop! What is it but my right? Am I robbin&rsquo; him? Isn&rsquo;t it due?
      Will he, or can he deny that? An&rsquo; if it&rsquo;s due isn&rsquo;t it but honest in him
      to pay it? They&rsquo;re not livin&rsquo; can say I ever defrauded them of a penny. I
      never broke a bargain; an&rsquo; yet you open on me, Honora, as if I was a
      rogue! If I hadn&rsquo;t that boy below to provide for, an&rsquo; settle in the world,
      what &lsquo;ud I care about money? It&rsquo;s for his sake I look afther my right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll allow the money,&rdquo; said Bartle. &ldquo;Fardorougha&rsquo;s right; it&rsquo;s due, an&rsquo; 
      I&rsquo;ll pay him&mdash;ay will I, Fardorougha, settle wid you to the last
      farden, or beyant it if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t take a farden beyant it, in the shape of debt. Them that&rsquo;s
      decent enough to make a present, may&mdash;for that&rsquo;s a horse of another
      color.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When will I come home?&rdquo; inquired Bartle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may stay at home now that you&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;An&rsquo; in the
      mane time, go an&rsquo; help Connor put that hay in lap-cocks. Anything you want
      to bring here you can bring afther your day&rsquo;s work tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ate your dinner, Bartle?&rdquo; said Honora; &ldquo;bekase if you didn&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ll
      get you something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not to this time o&rsquo; day he&rsquo;d be without his dinner, I suppose,&rdquo;
       observed his new master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very right, Fardorougha,&rdquo; rejoined Bartle; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thankful to you,
      ma&rsquo;am, I did ate my dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll get a rake in the barn, Bartle,&rdquo; said his master; &ldquo;an&rsquo; now
      tramp down to Connor, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll see how you&rsquo;ll handle yourselves, both o&rsquo; 
      you, from this till night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bartle accordingly&mdash;proceeded towards the meadow, and Fardorougha, as
      was his custom, throwing his great coat loosely about his shoulders, the
      arms dangling on each side of him, proceeded to another part of his farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flanagan&rsquo;s step, on his way to join Connor, was slow and meditative. The
      kindness of the son and mother touched him; for the line between their
      disposition and Fardorougha&rsquo;s was too strong and clear to allow the
      slightest suspicion of their participation in the spirit which regulated
      his life. The father, however, had just declared that his anxiety to
      accumulate money arose from a wish to settle his son independently in
      life; and Flanagan was too slightly acquainted with human character to see
      through this flimsy apology for extortion. He took it for granted that
      Fardorougha spoke truth, and his resolution received a bias from the
      impression, which, however, his better nature determined to subdue. In
      this uncertain state of mind he turned about almost instinctively, to look
      in the direction which Fardorougha had taken, and as he observed his
      diminutive figure creeping along with his great coat about him, he felt
      that the very sight of the man who had broken up their hearth and
      scattered them on the world, filled his heart with a deep and deadly
      animosity that occasioned him to pause as a person would do who finds
      himself unexpectedly upon the brink of a precipice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connor, on seeing him enter the meadow with the rake, knew at once that
      the terms had been concluded between them; and the excellent young man&rsquo;s
      heart was deeply moved at the destitution which forced Flanagan to seek
      for service with the very individual who had occasioned it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, Bartle,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you have agreed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have,&rdquo; replied Bartle. &ldquo;But if there had been any other place to be
      got in the parish&mdash;(an&rsquo; indeed only for the state I&rsquo;m in)&mdash;I
      wouldn&rsquo;t have hired myself to him for nothing, or next to nothing, as I
      have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what did he promise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three pounds a year, an&rsquo; out o&rsquo; that I&rsquo;m to pay him fifteen shillings
      that my father owes him still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Close enough, Bartle, but don&rsquo;t be cast down; I&rsquo;ll undertake that my
      mother an&rsquo; I will double it&mdash;an&rsquo; as for the fifteen shillings I&rsquo;ll
      pay them out o&rsquo; my own pocket&mdash;when I get money. I needn&rsquo;t tell you
      that we&rsquo;re all kept upon the tight crib, and that little cash goes far
      with us; for all that, we&rsquo;ll do what I promise, go as it may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more than I ought to expect, Connor; but yourself and your mother,
      all the counthry would put their hands undher both your feets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would give a great dale, Bartle, that my poor father had a little of
      the feelin&rsquo; that&rsquo;s in my mother&rsquo;s heart; but it&rsquo;s his way, Bartle, an&rsquo; you
      know he&rsquo;s my father, an&rsquo; has been kinder to me than to any livin&rsquo; creature
      on this earth. I never got a harsh word from him yet. An&rsquo; if he kept me
      stinted in many things that I was entitled to as well as other persons
      like me, still, Bartle, he loves me, an&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t but feel great affection
      for him, love the money as he may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was spoken with much seriousness of manner not unmingled with
      somewhat of regret, if not sorrow. Bartle fixed his eye upon the fine face
      of his companion, with a look in which there was a character of
      compassion. His countenance, however, while he gazed on him, maintained
      his natural color&mdash;it was not pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry, Connor,&rdquo; said he slowly, &ldquo;I am sorry that I hired with your
      father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; I&rsquo;m glad of it,&rdquo; replied the other; &ldquo;why should you be sorry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bartle made no answer for some time, but looked into the ground, as if he
      had not heard him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you be sorry, Bartle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nearly a minute elapsed before his abstraction was broken. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
       said he at length. &ldquo;What were you asking me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said you were sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ay!&rdquo; returned the other, interrupting him; &ldquo;but I didn&rsquo; mind what I
      was sayin&rsquo;: &lsquo;twas thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; else I was&mdash;of home, Bartle,
      an&rsquo; what we&rsquo;re brought to; but the best way&rsquo;s to dhrop all discoorse about
      that forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be my friend if you do,&rdquo; said Connor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, then,&rdquo; replied Bartle; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll change it. Connor, were you ever in
      love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      O&rsquo;Donovan turned quickly about, and, with a keen glance at Bartle,
      replied,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know; I believe I might, once or so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>am</i>,&rdquo; said Flanagan, bitterly; &ldquo;I <i>am</i> Connor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; who&rsquo;s the happy crature, will you tell us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned the other; &ldquo;but if there&rsquo;s a wish that I&rsquo;d make against my
      worst enemy, &lsquo;twould be, that he might love a girl above his means; or if
      he was her aquil, or even near her aquil, that he might be brought&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;he
      paused, but immediately proceeded, &ldquo;Well, no matter, I am, indeed,
      Connor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; is the girl fond o&rsquo; you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; my mind was made up to tell her but it&rsquo;s past that now; I
      know she&rsquo;s wealthy and proud both, and so is all her family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know she&rsquo;s proud when you never put the subject to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sayin&rsquo; she&rsquo;s proud, in one sinse; wid respect to herself, I
      believe; she&rsquo;s humble enough; I mane, she doesn&rsquo;t give herself many airs,
      but her people&rsquo;s as proud as the very sarra, an&rsquo; never match below them;
      still, if I&rsquo;d opportunities of bain&rsquo; often in her company, I&rsquo;d not fear to
      trust to a sweet tongue for comin&rsquo; round her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never despair, Bartle,&rdquo; said Connor; &ldquo;you know the ould proverb, &rsquo;a
      faintheart;&rsquo; however, settin&rsquo; the purty crature aside, whoever she is, I
      think if we divided ourselves&mdash;you to that side, an&rsquo; me to this&mdash;we&rsquo;d
      get this hay lapped in half the time; or do you take which side you
      plase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bargain,&rdquo; said Bartle; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a trawneen; I&rsquo;ll stay where I
      am, thin, an&rsquo; do you go beyant; let us hurry, too, for, if I&rsquo;m not
      mistaken, it&rsquo;s too sultry to be long without rain, the sky, too, is
      gettin&rsquo; dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I observed as much myself,&rdquo; said Connor; &ldquo;an&rsquo; that was what made me
      spake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both then continued their labor with redoubled energy, nor ceased for a
      moment until the task was executed, and the business of the day concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flanagan&rsquo;s observation was indeed correct, as to the change in the day and
      the appearance of the sky. From the hour of five o&rsquo;clock the darkness
      gradually deepened, until a dead black shadow, fearfully still and solemn,
      wrapped the whole horizon. The sun had altogether disappeared, and nothing
      was visible in the sky but one unbroken mass of darkness, unrelieved even
      by a single pile of clouds. The animals, where they could, had betaken
      themselves to shelter; the fowls of the air sought the covert of the
      hedges, and ceased their songs; the larks fled from the mid-heaven; and
      occasionally might be seen a straggling bee hurrying homewards, careless
      of the flowers which tempted him in his path, and only anxious to reach
      his hive before the deluge should overtake him. The stillness indeed was
      awful, as was the gloomy veil which darkened the face of nature, and
      filled the mind with that ominous terror which presses upon the heart like
      a consciousness of guilt. In such a time, and under the aspect of a sky so
      much resembling the pall of death, there is neither mirth nor laughter,
      but that individuality of apprehension, which, whilst it throws the
      conscience in upon its own records, and suspends conversation, yet draws
      man to his fellows, as if mere contiguity were a safeguard against danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation between the two young men as they returned from their
      labor, was short but expressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bartle,&rdquo; said Connor, &ldquo;are you afeard of thundher? The rason I ask,&rdquo; he
      added, &ldquo;is, bekase your face is as white as a sheet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it from my mother,&rdquo; replied Flanagan, &ldquo;but at all evints such an
      evenin&rsquo; as this is enough to make the heart of any man quake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;ll feel my spirits low, by rason of the darkness, but I&rsquo;m not afraid.
      It&rsquo;s well for them that have a clear conscience; they say that a stormy
      sky is the face of an angry God&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; the thundher His voice,&rdquo; added Bartle; &ldquo;but why are the brute bastes
      an&rsquo; the birds afraid, that commit no sin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said his companion; &ldquo;it must be natural to be afraid, or
      why would they indeed?&mdash;but some people are naturally more timersome
      than others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I intinded to go home for my other clo&rsquo;es an&rsquo; linen this evenin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
       observed Bartle, &ldquo;but I won&rsquo;t go out to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must thin,&rdquo; said Connor; &ldquo;an, with the blessin&rsquo; o&rsquo; God, will too; come
      what may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what is there to bring you out, if it&rsquo;s a fair question to ax?&rdquo;
       inquired the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A promise, for one thing; an&rsquo; my own inclination&mdash;my own heart&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      nearer the thruth&mdash;for another. It&rsquo;s the first meetin&rsquo; that I an&rsquo; her
      I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to ever had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Thigham, Thighum</i>, I undherstand,&rdquo; said Flanagan; &ldquo;well, I&rsquo;ll stay
      at home; but, sure it&rsquo;s no harm to wish you success&mdash;an&rsquo; that,
      Connor, is more than I&rsquo;ll ever have where I wish for it most.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This closed their dialogue, and both entered Fardorougha&rsquo;s house in
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up until twilight, the darkness of the dull and heavy sky was unbroken;
      but towards the west there was seen a streak whose color could not be
      determined as that of blood or fire. By its angry look, it seemed as if
      the sky in that quarter were about to burst forth in one awful sweep of
      conflagration. Connor observed it, and very correctly anticipated the
      nature and consequences of its appearance; but what will not youthful love
      dare and overcome? With an undismayed heart he set forward on his journey,
      which we leave him to pursue, and beg permission, meanwhile, to transport
      the reader to a scene distant about two miles farther towards the&mdash;inland
      part of the country.

    <h2>
      PART II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The dwelling of Bodagh Buie O&rsquo;Brien, to which Connor is now directing his
      steps, was a favorable specimen of that better class of farm-houses
      inhabited by our most extensive and wealthy agriculturists. It was a
      large, whitewashed, ornamentally thatched building, that told by its
      external aspect of the good living, extensive comforts, and substantial
      opulence which prevailed within. Stretched before its hall-door was a
      small lawn, bounded on the left by a wall that separated it from the
      farm-yard into which the kitchen door opened. Here were stacks of hay,
      oats, and wheat, all upon an immense scale, both as to size and number;
      together with threshing and winnowing machines, improved ploughs, carts,
      cars, and all the other modern implements of an extensive farm. Very
      cheering, indeed, was the din of industry that arose from the clank of
      machinery, the grunting of hogs, the cackling of geese, the quacking of
      ducks, and all the various other sounds which proceeded from what at first
      sight might have appeared to be rather a scene of confusion, but which, on
      closer inspection, would be found a rough yet well&mdash;regulated system,
      in which every person had an allotted duty to perform. Here might Bodagh
      Buie be seen, dressed in a gray broad-cloth coat, broad kerseymere
      breeches, and lambs&rsquo; wool stockings, moving from place to place with that
      calm, sedate, and contented air, which betokens an easy mind and a
      consciousness of possessing a more than ordinary share of property and
      influence. With hands thrust into his small-clothes pockets, and a bunch
      of gold seals suspended from his fob, he issued his orders in a grave and
      quiet tone, differing very little in dress from an absolute <i>Squireen</i>,
      save in the fact of his Caroline hat being rather scuffed, and his strong
      shoes begrimed with the soil of his fields or farm-yard. Mrs. O&rsquo;Brien was,
      out of the sphere of her own family, a person of much greater pretension
      than the Bodagh her husband; and, though in a different manner, not less
      so in the discharge of her duty as a wife, a mother, or a mistress. In
      appearance, she was a large, fat, good-looking woman, eternally in a state
      of motion and bustle, and, as her education had been extremely scanty, her
      tone and manner, though brimful of authority and consequence, were
      strongly marked with that ludicrous vulgarity which is produced by the
      attempt of an ignorant person to accomplish a high style of gentility. She
      was a kind-hearted, charitable woman, however; but so inveterately
      conscious of her station in life, that it became, in her opinion, a matter
      of duty to exhibit a refinement and elevation of language suitable to a
      matron who could drive every Sunday to Mass on her own jaunting car. When
      dressed on these Occasions in her rich rustling silks, she had, what is
      called in Ireland, a comfortable <i>flaghoola</i> look, but at the same
      time a carriage so stiff and rustic, as utterly overcame all her attempts,
      dictated as they were by the simplest vanity, at enacting the arduous and
      awful character of a Squireen&rsquo;s wife. Their family consisted of a son and
      daughter; the former, a young man of a very amiable disposition, was, at
      the present period of our story, a student in Maynooth College, and the
      latter, now in her nineteenth year, a promising pupil in a certain
      seminary for young ladies, conducted by that notorious Master of Arts,
      Little Cupid. Oona, or Una, O&rsquo;Brien, was in truth a most fascinating and
      beautiful brunette; tall in stature, light and agile in all her motions,
      cheerful and sweet in temper, but with just as much of that winning
      caprice, as was necessary to give zest and piquancy to her whole
      character. Though tall and slender, her person was by no means thin; on
      the contrary, her limbs and figure were very gracefully rounded, and gave
      promise of that agreeable fulness, beneath or beyond which no perfect
      model of female proportion can exist. If our readers could get one glance
      at the hue of her rich cheek, or fall for a moment under the power of her
      black mellow eye, or witness the beauty of her white teeth, while her face
      beamed with a profusion of dimples, or saw her while in the act of shaking
      out her invincible locks, ere she bound them up with her white and
      delicate hands&mdash;then, indeed, might they understand why no war of the
      elements could prevent Connor O&rsquo;Donovan from risking life and limb sooner
      than disappoint her in the promise of their first meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh that first meeting of pure and youthful love! With what a glory is it
      ever encircled in the memory of the human heart! No matter how long or how
      melancholy the lapse of time since its past existence may be, still,
      still, is it remembered by our feelings when the recollection of every tie
      but itself has departed. The charm, however, that murmured its many-toned
      music through the soul of Una O&rsquo;Brien was not, upon the evening in
      question, wholly free from a shade of melancholy for which she could not
      account; and this impression did not result from any previous examination
      of her love for Connor O&rsquo;Donovan, though many such she had. She knew that
      in this the utmost opposition from both her parents must be expected; nor
      was it the consequence of a consciousness on her part, that in promising
      him a clandestine meeting, she had taken a step which could not be
      justified. Of this, too, she had been aware before; but, until the hour of
      appointment drew near, the heaviness which pressed her down was such as
      caused her to admit that the sensation, however painful and gloomy, was
      new to her, and bore a character distinct from anything that could proceed
      from the various lights in which she had previously considered her
      attachment. This was, moreover, heightened by the boding aspect of the
      heavens and the dread repose of the evening, so unlike anything she had
      ever witnessed before. Notwithstanding all this, she was sustained by the
      eager and impatient buoyancy of first affection; which, when imagination
      pictured the handsome form of her young and manly lover, predominated for
      the time over every reflection and feeling that was opposed to itself. Her
      mind, indeed, resembled a fair autumn landscape, over which the
      cloud-shadows may be seen sweeping for a moment, whilst again the sun
      comes out and turns all into serenity and light.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place appointed for their interview was a small paddock shaded by
      alders, behind her father&rsquo;s garden, and thither, with trembling limbs and
      palpitating heart, did the young and graceful daughter of Bodagh Buie
      proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a considerable time, that is to say, for three long years before this
      delicious appointment, had Connor O&rsquo;Donovan and Una been wrapped in the
      elysium of mutual love. At mass, at fair, and at market, had they often
      and often met, and as frequently did their eyes search each other out, and
      reveal in long blushing glances the state of their respective hearts. Many
      a time did he seek an opportunity to disclose what he felt, and as often,
      with confusion, and fear, and delight, did she afford him what he sought.
      Thus did one opportunity after another pass away, and as often did he form
      the towering resolution to reveal his affection if he were ever favored
      with another. Still would some disheartening reflection, arising from the
      uncommon gentleness and extreme modesty of his character, throw a damp
      upon his spirit. He questioned his own penetration; perhaps she was in the
      habit of glancing as much at others as she glanced at him. Could it be
      possible that the beautiful daughter of Bodagh Buie, the wealthiest man,
      and of his wife, the proudest woman, within a large circle of the country,
      would love the son of Fardorougha Donovan, whose name had, alas, become so
      odious and unpopular? But then the blushing face, and dark lucid eyes, and
      the long earnest glance, rose before his imagination, and told him that,
      let the difference in the character and the station of their parents be
      what it might, the fair dark daughter of O&rsquo;Brien was not insensible to
      him, nor to the anxieties he felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The circumstance which produced the first conversation they ever had arose
      from an incident of a very striking and singular character. About a week
      before the evening in question, one of Bodagh Buie&rsquo;s bee-skeps hived, and
      the young colony, though closely watched and pursued, directed their
      course to Fardorougha&rsquo;s house, and settled in the mouth of the chimney.
      Connor, having got a clean sheet, secured them, and was about to submit
      them to the care of the Bodagh&rsquo;s servants, when it was suggested that the
      duty of bringing them home devolved on himself, inasmuch as he was told
      they would not remain, unless placed in a new skep by the hands of the
      person on whose property they had settled. While on his way to the
      Bodagh&rsquo;s he was accosted in the following words by one of O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s
      servants:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor, there&rsquo;s good luck before you, or the bees wouldn&rsquo;t pick you out
      amongst all the rest o&rsquo; the neighbors. You ought to hould up your head,
      man. Who knows what mainin&rsquo;s in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, do you b&rsquo;lieve that bees sittin&rsquo; wid one is a sign o&rsquo; good luck?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely I do. Doesn&rsquo;t every one know it to be thrue? Connor, you&rsquo;re a
      good-lookin&rsquo; fellow, an&rsquo; I need scarcely tell you that we have a purty
      girl at home; can you lay that an&rsquo; that together? Arrah, be my sowl, the
      richest honey ever the same bees&rsquo;ll make, is nothin&rsquo; but alloways,
      compared wid that purty mouth of her own! A honey-comb is a fool to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, did you ever thry, Mike?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it me? Och, och, if I was only high enough in this world, maybe I
      wouldn&rsquo;t be spakin&rsquo; sweet to her; no, no, be my word! thry, indeed, for
      the likes o&rsquo; me! Faith, but I know a sartin young man that she does be
      often spakin&rsquo; about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connor&rsquo;s heart was in a state of instant commotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; who&mdash;who is he&mdash;who is that sartin young man, Mike?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, the son o&rsquo; one that can run a shillin&rsquo; farther than e&rsquo;er another
      man in the country. Do you happen to be acquainted wid one Connor
      O&rsquo;Donovan, of Lisnamona?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor O&rsquo;Donovan&mdash;that&rsquo;s good, Mike&mdash;in the mane time don&rsquo;t be
      goin&rsquo; it on us. No, no;&mdash;an&rsquo; even if she did, it isn&rsquo;t to you she
      spake about any one, Michael ahagur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nor it wasn&rsquo;t to me&mdash;sure I didn&rsquo;t say it was&mdash;but don&rsquo;t
      you know my sister&rsquo;s at sarvice in the Bodagh&rsquo;s family? Divil the word o&rsquo; 
      falsity I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; you; so, if you haven&rsquo;t the heart to spake for
      yourself, I wouldn&rsquo;t give knots o&rsquo; straws for you; and now, there&rsquo;s no
      harm done I hope&mdash;moreover, an&rsquo; by the same token, you needn&rsquo;t go to
      the trouble o&rsquo; puttin&rsquo; up an advertisement to let the parish know what
      I&rsquo;ve tould you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hut, tut, Mike, it&rsquo;s all folly. Una Dhun O&rsquo;Brien to think of me!&mdash;nonsense,
      man; that cock would never fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; divil a morsel of us is forcin&rsquo; you to b&rsquo;lieve it. I suppose
      the mother o&rsquo; you has your <i>wooden spoon</i> to the fore still. I&rsquo;d kiss
      the Bravery you didn&rsquo;t come into the world wid a silver ladle in your
      mouth, anyhow. In the mane time, we&rsquo;re at the Bodagh&rsquo;s&mdash;an&rsquo; have an
      eye about you afther what you&rsquo;ve heard&mdash;<i>Nabocklish!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, indeed, was important intelligence to Connor, and it is probable
      that, had he not heard it, another opportunity of disclosing his passion
      might have been lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Independently of this, however, he was not proof against the popular
      superstition of the bees, particularly as it appeared to be an augury to
      which his enamored heart could cling with all the hope of young and
      passionate enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was it long till he had an opportunity of perceiving that she whose
      image had floated in light before his fancy, gave decided manifestations
      of being struck by the same significant occurrence. On entering the
      garden, the first person his eye rested upon was Una herself, who, as some
      of the other hives were expected to swarm, had been engaged watching them
      during the day. His appearance at any time would have created a tumult in
      her bosom, but, in addition to this, when she heard that the bees which
      had rested on Connor&rsquo;s house, had swarmed from <i>her own hive</i>, to use
      the words of Burns&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     She looked&mdash;she reddened like the rose,
     Syne pale as ony lily,
</pre>
    <p>
      and, with a shy but expressive glance at Connor, said, in a low hurried
      voice, &ldquo;These belong to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Until the moment we are describing, Connor and she, notwithstanding that
      they frequently met in public places, had never yet spoken; nor could the
      words now uttered by Una be considered as addressed to him, although from
      the glance that accompanied them it was sufficiently evident that they
      were intended for him alone. It was in vain that he attempted to accost
      her; his confusion, her pleasure, his timidity, seemed to unite in
      rendering him incapable of speaking at all. His lips moved several times,
      but the words, as they arose, died away unspoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, Mike, with waggish good-humor, and in a most laudable fit
      of industry, reminded the other servants, who had been assisting to secure
      the bees, that as they (the bees) were now safe, no further necessity
      existed for their presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, boys&mdash;death-alive, the day&rsquo;s passin&rsquo;&mdash;only think. Miss
      Una, that we have all the hay in the Long-shot meadow to get into cocks
      yet, an&rsquo; here we&rsquo;re idlin&rsquo; an&rsquo; ghosther&mdash;in&rsquo; away our time like I
      dunna what. They&rsquo;re schamin&rsquo;, Miss Una&mdash;divil a thing else, an&rsquo; 
      what&rsquo;ll the masther say if the same meadow&rsquo;s not finished to&mdash;night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, Mike,&rdquo; replied Una&mdash;; &ldquo;if the meadow is to be finished this
      night, there&rsquo;s little time to be lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, boys,&rdquo; exclaimed Mike, &ldquo;you hear what Miss Una says&mdash;if it&rsquo;s
      to be finished to-night there&rsquo;s but little time to be lost&mdash;turn out&mdash;march.
      Miss Una can watch the bees widout our help. Good evenin&rsquo;, Misther
      Donovan; be my word, but you&rsquo;re entitled to a taste o&rsquo; honey any way, for
      bringing back Miss Una&rsquo;s bees to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mike, after having uttered this significant opinion relative to his sense
      of justice, drove his fellow-servants out of the garden, and left the
      lovers together. There was now a dead silence, during the greater part of
      which, neither dared to look at the other; at length each hazarded a
      glance; their eyes met, and their embarrassment deepened in a tenfold
      degree. Una, on withdrawing her gaze, looked with an air of perplexity
      from one object to another, and at length, with downcast lids, and glowing
      cheeks, her eyes became fixed on her own white and delicate finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who would think,&rdquo; said she, in a voice tremulous with agitation, &ldquo;that
      the sting of a bee could be so painful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connor advanced towards her with a beating heart. &ldquo;Where have you been
      stung, Miss O&rsquo;Brien?&rdquo; said he, in a tone shaken out of it&rsquo;s fulness by
      what he felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the finger,&rdquo; she replied, and she looked closely into the spot as she
      uttered the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you let me see it?&rdquo; asked Connor.
    </p>
    <p>
      She held her hand towards him without knowing what she did, nor was it
      till after a strong effort that Connor mastered himself so far as to ask
      her in which finger she felt the pain. In fact, both saw at once that
      their minds were engaged upon far different thoughts, and that their
      anxiety to pour out the full confession of their love was equally deep and
      mutual.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Connor put the foregoing question to her, he took her hand in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what finger?&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&mdash;indeed&mdash;I&mdash;I
      believe in the&mdash;the&mdash;but what&mdash;what is this?&mdash;I am
      very&mdash;very weak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me support you to the summer&mdash;house, where you can sit,&rdquo;
       returned Connor, still clasping her soft delicate hand in his; then,
      circling her slender waist with the other, he helped her to a seat under
      the thick shade of the osiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Una&rsquo;s countenance immediately became pale as death, and her whole frame
      trembled excessively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too weak even to sit without support,&rdquo; said Connor, &ldquo;your head is
      droopin&rsquo;. For God&rsquo;s sake, lean it over on me! Oh! I&rsquo;d give ten thousand
      lives to have it on my breast only for one moment!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her paleness still continued; she gazed on him, and, as he gently squeezed
      her hand, a slight pressure was given in return. He then drew her head
      over upon his shoulder, where it rather fell than leaned; a gush of tears
      came from her eyes, and the next moment, with sobbing hearts, they were
      encircled in each other&rsquo;s arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this first intoxicating draught of youthful love, they were startled
      by the voice of Mrs. O&rsquo;Brien calling upon her daughter, and, at the same
      time, to their utter dismay, they observed the portly dame sailing, in her
      usual state, down towards the arbor, with an immense bunch of keys
      dangling from her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oonagh, Miss&mdash;Miss Oonagh&mdash;where are you, Miss, Ma Colleen?&mdash;Here&rsquo;s
      a litther,&rdquo; she proceeded, when Una appeared, &ldquo;from Mrs. Fogarty, your
      school-misthress, to your fadher&mdash;statin&rsquo; that she wants you to
      finish your Jiggraphy at the dancin&rsquo;, wid a new dancin&rsquo;&mdash;teacher from
      <i>Dubling</i>. Why&mdash;Eah! what ails you, Miss, Ma Colleen? What the
      dickens wor you cryin&rsquo; for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These nasty bees that stung me,&rdquo; returned the girl. &ldquo;Oh, for goodness
      sake, mother dear, don&rsquo;t come any farther, except you wish to have a whole
      hive upon you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sure, they wouldn&rsquo;t sting any one that won&rsquo;t meddle wid them,&rdquo;
       replied the mother in a kind of alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sorra pin they care, mother&mdash;don&rsquo;t come near them; I&rsquo;ll be in,
      by an&rsquo; by. Where&rsquo;s my father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in the house, an&rsquo; wants you to answer Mrs. Fogarty, statin&rsquo; feder
      you&rsquo;ll take a month&rsquo;s larnin&rsquo; on the <i>flure</i> or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll see her letter in a minute or two, but you may tell my father
      he needn&rsquo;t wait&mdash;I won&rsquo;t answer it to-night at all event&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must answer it on the nail,&rdquo; replied her mother, &ldquo;becase the
      messager&rsquo;s waitin&rsquo; in the kitchen &lsquo;ithin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That alters the case altogether,&rdquo; returned Una, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll follow you
      immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The good woman then withdrew, having once more enjoined the daughter to
      avoid delay, and not to detain the messenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must go instantly,&rdquo; she said to Connor. &ldquo;Oh, what would happen me if
      they knew that I lov&mdash;that I&mdash;&rdquo; a short pause ensued, and she
      blushed deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, what you were goin&rsquo; to say,&rdquo; returned Connor; &ldquo;Oh, say that one
      word, and all the misfortunes that ever happened to man, can&rsquo;t make me
      unhappy! Oh, God! an&rsquo; is it possible? Say that word&mdash;Oh! say it&mdash;say
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;if they knew that I love the son of
      Fardorougha Donovan, what would become of me? Now go, for fear my father
      may come out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when will I see you again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; said she anxiously; &ldquo;go, you can easily see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when?&mdash;when? say on Thursday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so soon&mdash;not so soon,&rdquo; and she cast an anxious eye towards the
      garden gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When then&mdash;say this day week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well&mdash;but go&mdash;maybe my father has heard from the servants
      that you are here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dusk is the best time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;about dusk; under the alders, in the little green
      field behind the garden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show me the wounded finger,&rdquo; said he with a smile, &ldquo;before I go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said she, extending her hand; &ldquo;but for Heaven&rsquo;s sake go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you how to cure it,&rdquo; said he, tenderly; &ldquo;honey is the medicine;
      put that sweet finger to your own sweeter lip&mdash;and, afterwards, I&rsquo;ll
      carry home the wound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not the medicine, <i>now</i>,&rdquo; said she, and, snatching her hand from
      his, with light, fearful steps, she fled up the garden and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such, gentle reader, were the circumstances which brought our young and
      artless lovers together in the black twilight of the singularly awful and
      ominous evening which we have already described.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connor, on reaching the appointed spot, sat down; but his impatience soon
      overcame him; and, while hurrying to and fro, under the alders, he asked
      himself in what was this wild but rapturous attachment to terminate? That
      the proud Bodagh, and his prouder wife, would never suffer their beautiful
      daughter, the heiress of all their wealth, to marry the son of
      Fardorougha, the miser, was an axiom, the truth of which pressed upon his
      heart with a deadly weight. On the other hand, would his father, or rather
      could he, change his nature so far as to establish him in life, provided
      Una and he were united without the consent of her parents? Alas! he knew
      his father&rsquo;s parsimony too well; and, on either hand, he was met by
      difficulties that appeared to him to be insurmountable. But again came the
      delightful and ecstatic consciousness, that, let their parents act as they
      might, Una&rsquo;s heart and his were bound to each other by ties which, only to
      think of, was rapture. In the midst of these reflections, he heard her
      light foot approach, but with a step more slow and melancholy than he
      could have expected from the ardor of their love.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she approached, the twilight was just sufficient to enable him to
      perceive that her face was pale, and tinged apparently with melancholy, if
      not with sorrow. After the first salutations were over, he was proceeding
      to inquire into the cause of her depression, when, to his utter surprise,
      she placed her hands upon her face, and burst into a fit of grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who have loved need not be told that the most delightful office of
      that delightful passion is to dry the tears of the beloved one who is dear
      to us beyond all else that life contains. Connor literally performed this
      office, and inquired, in a tone so soothing and full of sympathy, why she
      wept, that her tears for a while only flowed the faster. At length her
      grief abated, and she was able to reply to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ask me why I am raying,&rdquo; said the fair young creature; &ldquo;but, indeed,
      I cannot tell you. There has been a sinking of the heart upon me during
      the greater part of this day. When I thought of our meeting I was
      delighted; but again some heaviness would come over me that I can&rsquo;t
      account for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what it is,&rdquo; replied Connor, &ldquo;a very simple thing; merely the
      terrible calm an&rsquo; blackness of the evenin&rsquo;. I was sunk myself a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to cry for a better reason,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;In meeting you I have
      done&mdash;an&rsquo; am doing&mdash;what I ought to be sorry for&mdash;that is,
      a wrong action that my conscience condemns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nobody perfect, my dear Una,&rdquo; said Connor; &ldquo;an&rsquo; none without
      their failins; they have little to answer for that have no more than you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t flatter me,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;if you love me as you say, never flatter
      me while you live; I will always speak what I feel, and I hope you&rsquo;ll do
      the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could spake what I feel,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you would still say I flattered
      you&mdash;it&rsquo;s not in the power of any words that ever were spoken, to
      tell how I love you&mdash;how much my heart an&rsquo; soul&rsquo;s fixed upon you.
      Little you know, my own dear Una, how unhappy I am this minute, to see you
      in low spirits. What do you think is the occasion of it? Spake now, as you
      say you will do, that is, as you feel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except it be that my heart brought me to meet you tonight contrary to my
      conscience, I do not know. Connor, Connor, that heart is so strongly in
      your favor, that if you were not to be happy neither could its poor
      owner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connor for a moment looked into the future, but, like the face of the sky
      above him, all was either dark or stormy; his heart sank, but the
      tenderness expressed in Una&rsquo;s last words filled his whole soul with a
      vehement and burning passion, which he felt must regulate his destiny in
      life, whether for good or evil. He pulled her to his breast, on which he
      placed her head; she looked up fondly to him, and, perceiving that he
      wrought under some deep and powerful struggle, said in a low, confiding
      voice, whilst the tears once more ran quietly down her cheeks, &ldquo;Connor,
      what I said is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My heart&rsquo;s burnin&rsquo;&mdash;my heart&rsquo;s burnin&rsquo;!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not
      love I feel for you, Una&mdash;it&rsquo;s more than love; oh, what is it&mdash;Una,
      Una, this I know, that I cannot live long without you, or from you; if I
      did, I&rsquo;d go wild or mad through the world. For the last three years you
      have never been out of my mind, I may say awake or asleep; for I believe a
      night never passed during that time that I didn&rsquo;t drame of you&mdash;of
      the beautiful young crature. Oh! God in heaven, can it be thrue that she
      loves me at last? Say them blessed words again, Una; oh, say them again!
      But I&rsquo;m too happy&mdash;I can hardly bear this delight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true that I love you, and if our parents could think as we do,
      Connor, how easy it would be for them to make us happy, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too soon, Una; it&rsquo;s too soon to spake of that. Happy! don&rsquo;t we love
      one another? Isn&rsquo;t that happiness? Who or what can deprive us of that? We
      are happy without them; we can be happy in spite of them; oh, my own fair
      girl! sweet, sweet life of my life, and heart of my heart! Heaven&mdash;heaven
      itself would be no heaven to me, if you weren&rsquo;t with me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that, Connor dear; it&rsquo;s wrong. Let us not forget what is due to
      religion, if we expect our love to prosper. You may think this strange
      from one that has acted contrary to religion in coming to meet you against
      the will and knowledge of her parents; but beyond that, dear Connor, I
      hope I never will go. But is it true that you&rsquo;ve loved me so long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;the second Sunday in May next was three years, I knelt
      opposite you at mass. You were on the left hand side of the altar, I was
      on the right; my eyes were never off you; indeed, you may remember it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a good right,&rdquo; said she, blushing and hiding her face on his
      shoulder. &ldquo;I ought to be ashamed to acknowledge it, an&rsquo; me so young at the
      time; little more than sixteen. From that day to this, my story has been
      just your own. Connor, can you tell me how I found it out but I knew you
      loved me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many a thing was to tell you that, Una dear. Sure my eyes were never off
      you, whenever you wor near me; an&rsquo; wherever you were, there was I certain
      to be too. I never missed any public place if I thought you would be at
      it, an&rsquo; that merely for the sake of seein&rsquo; you. An&rsquo;, now will you tell me
      why it was that I could &lsquo;a sworn you lov&rsquo;d me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have answered for us both,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;As for me, if I only chance
      to hear your name mentioned my heart would beat; if the talk was about you
      I could listen to nothing else, and I often felt the color come and go on
      my cheek.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Una, I never thought I could be born to such happiness. Now that I know
      that you love me, I can hardly think that it was love I felt for you all
      along; it&rsquo;s wonderful&mdash;it&rsquo;s wonderful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is so wonderful?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the change that I feel since knowin&rsquo; that you love me; since I had
      it from your own lips, it has overcome me&mdash;I&rsquo;m a child&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      anything, anything you choose to make me; it was never love&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      only since I found you loved me that my heart&rsquo;s burnin&rsquo; as it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make you happyr if I can,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;and keep you so, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing that will make me still happier than I am,&rdquo; said
      Connor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it? If it&rsquo;s proper and right I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Promise me that if I live you&rsquo;ll never marry any one else than me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish then to have the promise all on one side,&rdquo; she replied with a
      smile and a blush, each as sweet as ever captivated a human heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no, my darling Una, <i>acushla gra gal machree</i>, no! I will
      promise the same to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused, and a silence of nearly a minute ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s right, Connor; I have taken one wrong step as it
      is, but, well as I love you, I won&rsquo;t take another; whatever I do I must
      feel that it&rsquo;s proper. I&rsquo;m not sure that this is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you say you love me, Una?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do; you know I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only another question to ask; could you, or would you, love me as
      you do, and marry another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not, Connor, and would not, and will not. I am ready to promise;
      I may easily do it; for God knows the very thought of marrying another, or
      being deprived of you, is more than I can bear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; returned her lover, seizing her hand, &ldquo;I take God to witness
      that, whilst you are alive an&rsquo; faithful to me, I will never marry any
      woman but yourself. Now,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;put your right hand into mine,
      and say the same words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did so, and was in the act of repeating the form, &ldquo;I take God to
      witness&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; when a vivid flash of lightning shot from the
      darkness above them, and a peal of thunder almost immediately followed,
      with an explosion so loud as nearly to stun both. Una started with terror,
      and instinctively withdrew her hand from Connor&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God preserve us!&rdquo; she exclaimed; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s awful. Connor, I feel as if the
      act I am goin&rsquo; to do is not right. Let us put it off at all events, till
      another time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it because there comes an accidental brattle of thunder?&rdquo; he returned.
      &ldquo;Why, the thunder would come if we were never to change a promise. You
      have mine, now, Una dear, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m sure you wouldn&rsquo;t wish me to be bound
      an&rsquo; yourself free. Don&rsquo;t be afraid, darling; give me your hand, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t
      tremble so; repeat the words at wanst, an&rsquo; let it be over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He again took her hand, when she repeated the form in a distinct, though
      feeble voice, observing, when it was concluded,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Connor, I did this to satisfy you, but I still feel like one who has
      done a wrong action. I am yours now, but I cannot help praying to God that
      it may end happily for us both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must, darling Una&mdash;it must end happily for us both. How can it be
      otherwise? For my part, except to see you my wife, I couldn&rsquo;t be happier
      than I am this minute; exceptin&rsquo; that, my heart has all it wished for. Is
      it possible&mdash;Oh! is it possible that this is not a dream, my heart&rsquo;s
      life? But if it is&mdash;if it is&mdash;I never more will wish to waken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her young lover was deeply affected as he uttered these words, nor was Una
      proof against the emotion they produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could pray to God, this moment, with a purer heart than I ever had
      before,&rdquo; he proceeded, &ldquo;for makin&rsquo; my lot in life so happy. I feel that I
      am better and freer from sin than I ever was yet. If we&rsquo;re faithful and
      true to one another, what can the world do to us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t be otherwise than faithful to you,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;without
      being unhappy myself; an&rsquo; I trust it&rsquo;s no sin to love each other as we do.
      Now let us&mdash;&mdash;God bless me, what a flash! and here&rsquo;s the rain
      beginning. That thunder&rsquo;s dreadful; Heaven preserve us! It&rsquo;s an awful
      night! Connor, you must see me as far as the corner of the garden; as for
      you, I wish you were safe at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasten, dear,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;hasten; it&rsquo;s no night for you to be out in, now
      that the rain&rsquo;s coming. As for me, if it was ten times as dreadful I won&rsquo;t
      feel it. There&rsquo;s but one thought&mdash;one thought in my mind, and that I
      wouldn&rsquo;t part with for the wealth of the universe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both then proceeded at a quick puce until they reached the corner of
      Bodagh&rsquo;s garden, where, with brief but earnest reassurances of unalterable
      attachment, they took a tender and affectionate farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not often that the higher ranks can appreciate the moral beauty of
      love as it is experienced by those humbler classes to whom they deny the
      power of feeling in its most refined and exalted character. For our parts
      we differ so much from them in this, that, if we wanted to give an
      illustration of that passion in its purest and most delicate state, we
      would not seek for it in the saloon or the drawing&mdash;room, but among
      the green fields and the smiling landscapes of rural life. The simplicity
      of humble hearts is more accordant with the unity of affection than any
      mind can be that is distracted by the competition of rival claims upon its
      gratification. We do not say that the votaries of rank and fashion are
      insensible to love; because, how much soever they may be conversant with
      the artificial and unreal, still they are human, and must, to a certain
      extent, be influenced by a principle that acts wherever it can find a
      heart on which to operate. We say, however, that their love, when
      contrasted with that which is felt by the humble peasantry, is languid and
      sickly; neither so pure, nor so simple, nor so intense. Its associations
      in high life are unfavorable to the growth of a healthy passion; for what
      is the glare of a lamp, a twirl through the insipid maze of the ball-room,
      or the unnatural distortions of the theatre, when compared to the rising
      of the summer sun, the singing of birds, the music of the streams, the
      joyous aspect of the varied landscape, the mountain, the valley, the lake,
      and a thousand other objects, each of which transmits to the peasant&rsquo;s
      heart silently and imperceptibly that subtle power which at once
      strengthens and purifies the passion? There is scarcely such a thing as
      solitude in the upper ranks, nor an opportunity of keeping the feelings
      unwasted, and the energies of the heart unspent by the many vanities and
      petty pleasures with which fashion forces a compliance, until the mind
      falls from its natural dignity, into a habit of coldness and aversion to
      everything but the circle of empty trifles in which it moves so giddily.
      But the enamored youth who can retire to the beautiful solitude of the
      still glen to brood over the image of her he loves, and who, probably,
      sits under the very tree where his love was avowed and returned; he, we
      say, exalted with the fulness of his happiness, feels his heart go abroad
      in gladness upon the delighted objects that surround him, for everything
      that he looks upon is as a friend; his happy heart expands over the whole
      landscape; his eye glances to the sky; he thinks of the Almighty Being
      above him, and though without any capacity to analyze his own feelings&mdash;love&mdash;the
      love of some humble, plain but modest girl&mdash;kindles by degrees into
      the sanctity and rapture of religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let not our readers of rank, then, if any such may honor our pages with a
      perusal, be at all surprised at the expression of Connor O&rsquo;Donovan when,
      under the ecstatic power of a love so pure and artless as that which bound
      his heart and Una&rsquo;s together, he exclaimed, as he did, &ldquo;Oh! I could pray
      to God this moment with a purer heart than I ever had before!&rdquo; Such a
      state of feeling among the people is neither rare nor anomalous; for,
      however, the great ones and the wise ones of the world may be startled at
      our assertion, we beg to assure them that love and religion are more
      nearly related to each other than those, who have never felt either in its
      truth and purity, can imagine.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Connor performed his journey home, the thunder tempest passed fearfully
      through the sky; and, though the darkness was deep and unbroken by
      anything but the red flashes of lightning, yet, so strongly absorbed was
      his heart by the scene we have just related, that he arrived at his
      father&rsquo;s house scarcely conscious of the roar of elements which surrounded
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family had retired to bed when he entered, with the exception of his
      parents, who, having felt uneasy at his disappearance, were anxiously
      awaiting his return, and entering into fruitless conjectures concerning
      the cause of an absence so unusual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What,&rdquo; said the alarmed mother, &ldquo;what in the wide world could keep him so
      long out, and on sich a tempest as is in it? God protect my boy from all
      harm an&rsquo; danger, this fearful night! Oh, Fardorougha, what &lsquo;ud become of
      us if anything happened him? As for me&mdash;my heart&rsquo;s wrapped up in him;
      wid&mdash;out our darlin&rsquo; it &lsquo;ud break, break, Fardorougha.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hut; he&rsquo;s gone to some neighbor&rsquo;s an&rsquo; can&rsquo;t come out till the storm is
      over; he&rsquo;ll soon be here now that the thunder an&rsquo; lightnin&rsquo;s past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But did you never think, Fardorougha, what &lsquo;ud become of you, or what
      you&rsquo;d do or how you&rsquo;d live, if anything happened him? which the Almighty
      forbid this night and forever! Could you live widout him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man gazed upon her like one who felt displeasure at having a
      contingency so painful forced upon his consideration. Without making any
      reply, however, he looked thoughtfully into the fire for some time, after
      which he rose up, and, with a querulous and impatient voice, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of thinkin&rsquo; about sich things? Lose him! why would I lose
      him? I couldn&rsquo;t lose him&mdash;I&rsquo;d as soon lose my own life&mdash;I&rsquo;d
      rather be dead at wanst than lose him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows your love for him is a quare love, Fardorougha,&rdquo; rejoined the
      wife; &ldquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t give him a guinea if it &lsquo;ud save his life, or allow
      him even a few shillings now an&rsquo; then, for pocket-money, that he might be
      aquil to other young boys like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use, no use in that, except to bring him into drink an&rsquo; other bad
      habits; a bad way, Honora, of showin&rsquo; one&rsquo;s love for him. If you had your
      will you&rsquo;d spoil him; I&rsquo;m keepin&rsquo; whatsomever little shillin&rsquo;s we&rsquo;ve
      scraped together to settle him dacently in life; but, indeed, that&rsquo;s time
      enough yet; he&rsquo;s too young to marry for some years to come, barrin&rsquo; he got
      a fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, one thing, Fardorougha, if ever two people were blessed in a good
      son, praise be God we are that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are, Honor, we are; there&rsquo;s not his aquil in the parish&mdash;<i>achora
      machree</i> that he is. When I&rsquo;m gone he&rsquo;ll know what I&rsquo;ve done for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whin you&rsquo;re gone; why, Saver of arth, sure you wouldn&rsquo;t keep him out of
      his&mdash;&mdash; husth!&mdash;&mdash;here he is, God be thanked! poor boy
      he&rsquo;s safe. Oh, thin, <i>vich no Hoiah</i>, Connor jewel, were you out
      undher this terrible night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor, <i>avich machree</i>,&rdquo; added the father, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re lost! My hand to
      you, if he&rsquo;s worth three hapuns; sthrip an&rsquo; throw my Cothamore about you,
      an&rsquo; draw in to the fire; you&rsquo;re fairly lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m worth two lost people yet,&rdquo; said Connor, smiling; &ldquo;mother, did you
      ever see a pleasanter night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pleasant, Connor, darlin&rsquo;! Oh thin it&rsquo;s you may say so, I&rsquo;m sure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, you&rsquo;re a worthy&mdash;only your Cothamore&rsquo;s too scimpt for me.
      Faith, mother, although you think I&rsquo;m jokin&rsquo;, the devil a one o&rsquo; me is; a
      pleasanter night&mdash;a happier night I never spent. Father, you ought to
      be proud o&rsquo; me, an&rsquo; stretch out a bit with the cash; faith, I&rsquo;m nothin&rsquo; 
      else than a fine handsome young fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be me soul an&rsquo; he ought to be proud out of you, Connor, whether you&rsquo;re in
      arnest or not,&rdquo; observed the mother, &ldquo;an&rsquo; to stretch out wid the <i>arrighad</i>
      too if you want it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Folly on, Connor, folly on! your mother&rsquo;ll back you, I&rsquo;ll go bail, say
      what you will; but sure you know all I have must be yours yet, acushla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connor now sat down, and his mother stirred up the fire, on which she
      placed additional fuel. After a little time his manner changed, and a
      shade of deep gloom fell upon his manly and handsome features. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      know,&rdquo; he at length proceeded, &ldquo;that, as we three are here together, I
      could do betther than ask your advice upon what has happened to me
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what has happened you, Connor?&rdquo; said the mother alarmed; &ldquo;plase God,
      no harm, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who else,&rdquo; added the father, &ldquo;would you be guided by, if not by your
      mother an&rsquo; myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No harm, mother, dear,&rdquo; said Connor in reply to her; &ldquo;harm! Oh! mother,
      mother, if you knew it; an&rsquo; as for what you say, father, it&rsquo;s right; what
      advice but my mother&rsquo;s an&rsquo; yours ought I to ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; God&rsquo;s too,&rdquo; added the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; my heart was nevir more <i>ris</i> to God than it was&rsquo;, an&rsquo; is this
      night,&rdquo; replied their ingenuous boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but what has happened, Connor?&rdquo; said his father; &ldquo;if it&rsquo;s anything
      where our advice can serve you, of coorse we&rsquo;ll advise you for the best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connor then, with a glowing heart, made them acquainted with the affection
      which subsisted between himself and Una O&rsquo;Brien, and ended by informing
      them of the vow of marriage which they had that night solemnly pledged to
      each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You both know her by sight,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;an&rsquo; afther what I&rsquo;ve sed, can you
      blame me for sayin&rsquo; that I found this a pleasant and a happy night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The affectionate mother&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears of pride and delight, on
      hearing that her handsome son was loved by the beautiful daughter of
      Bodagh Buie, and she could not help exclaiming, in the enthusiasm of the
      moment,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a purty girl&mdash;the purtiest indeed I ever laid my two livin&rsquo; 
      eyes upon, and by all accounts as good as she&rsquo;s purty; but I say that,
      face to face, you&rsquo;re as good, ay, an&rsquo; as handsome, Fardorougha, as she is.
      God bless her, any way, an&rsquo; mark her to grace and happiness, <i>ma colleen
      dhas dhun</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s no match for her,&rdquo; said the father, who had listened with an earnest
      face, and compressed lips, to his son&rsquo;s narrative; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s no match for her&mdash;by
      four hundred guineas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Honora, when he uttered the previous part of his observation, looked upon
      him with a flash of indignant astonishment; but when he had concluded, her
      countenance fell back into its original expression. It was evident that,
      while she, with the feelings of a woman and a mother, instituted a
      parallel between their personal merits alone, the husband viewed their
      attachment through that calculating spirit which had regulated his whole
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re thinkin&rsquo; of her money now,&rdquo; she added; &ldquo;but remimber, Fardorougha,
      that it wasn&rsquo;t born wid her. An&rsquo; I hope, Connor, it&rsquo;s not for her money
      that you have any grah for her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may swear that, mother; I love her little finger betther than all the
      money in the king&rsquo;s bank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor, avich, your mother has made a fool of you, or you wouldn&rsquo;t spake
      the nonsense you spoke this minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word to you, father, I&rsquo;ll take all the money I&rsquo;ll get; but what am I
      to do? Bodagh Buie an&rsquo; his wife will never consent to allow her to marry
      me, I can tell you; an&rsquo; if she marries me without their consent, you both
      know I have no way of supportin&rsquo; her, except you, father, assist me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That won&rsquo;t be needful, Connor; you may manage them; they won&rsquo;t see her
      want; she&rsquo;s an only daughter; they couldn&rsquo;t see her want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t he an only son, Fardorougha?&rdquo; exclaimed the wife. &ldquo;An&rsquo; my sowl
      to happiness but I believe you&rsquo;d see him want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any way,&rdquo; replied her husband, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not for matches against the consint
      of parents; they&rsquo;re not lucky; or can&rsquo;t you run away wid her, an&rsquo; thin
      refuse marryin&rsquo; her except they come down wid the cash?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, father!&rdquo; exclaimed Connor, &ldquo;father, father, to become a villain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor,&rdquo; said his mother, rising up in a spirit of calm and mournful
      solemnity, &ldquo;never heed; go to bed, achora, go to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of coorse I&rsquo;ll never heed, mother,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t help sayin&rsquo; 
      that, happy as I was awhile agone, my father is sendin&rsquo; me to bed with a
      heavy heart. When I asked your advice, father, little I thought it would
      be to do&mdash;but no matter; I&rsquo;ll never be guilty of an act that &lsquo;ud
      disgrace my name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, avillish,&rdquo; said his mother, &ldquo;you never will; God knows it&rsquo;s as much
      an&rsquo; more than you an&rsquo; other people can do, to keep the name we have in
      decency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine talk,&rdquo; observed Fardorougha, &ldquo;but what I advise has been done
      by hundreds that wor married an&rsquo; happy afterwards; how&mdash;an&mdash;iver
      you needn&rsquo;t get into a passion, either of you; I&rsquo;m not pressin&rsquo; you,&rsquo; 
      Connor, to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor, achree,&rdquo; said his mother, &ldquo;go to bed, an&rsquo; instead of the advice
      you got, ax God&rsquo;s; go, avillish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connor, without making any further observation, sought his sleeping-room,
      where, having recommended himself to God, in earnest prayer, he lay
      revolving all that had occurred that night, until the gentle influence of
      sleep at length drew him into oblivion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said his mother to Fardorougha, when Connor had gone, &ldquo;you must
      sleep by yourself; for, as for me, my side I&rsquo;ll not stretch on the same
      bed wid you to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, I can&rsquo;t help that,&rdquo; said her husband; &ldquo;all I can say is this,
      that I&rsquo;m not able to put sinse or prudence into you or Connor; so, since
      you won&rsquo;t be guided by me, take your own coorse. Bodagh Buie&rsquo;s very well
      able to provide for them&mdash;; an&rsquo; if he won&rsquo;t do so before they marry,
      why let Connor have nothing to say to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Fardorougha, God wouldn&rsquo;t be in heaven, or you&rsquo;ll get
      a cut heart yet, either through your son or your money; an&rsquo; that it may
      not be through my darlin&rsquo; boy, O, grant, sweet Saver o&rsquo; the earth, this
      night! I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to sleep wid Biddy Casey, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll find a clane
      nightcap on the rail o&rsquo; the bed; an&rsquo;, Fardorougha, afore you put it an,
      kneel down an&rsquo; pray to God to change your heart&mdash;for it wants it&mdash;it
      wants it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In Ireland the first object of a servant man, after entering the
      employment of his master, is to put himself upon an amicable footing with
      his fellow-servants of the other sex. Such a step, besides being natural
      in itself, is often taken in consequence of the <i>esprit du corps</i>
      which prevails among persons of that class. Bartle Flanagan, although he
      could not be said to act from any habit previously acquired in service,
      went to work with all the tact and adroitness of a veteran. The next
      morning, after having left the barn where he slept, he contrived to throw
      himself in the way of Biddy Duggan, a girl, who, though vain and simple,
      was at the same time conscientious and honest. On passing from the barn to
      the kitchen, he noticed her returning from the well with a pitcher of
      water in each hand, and as it is considered an act of civil attention for
      the male servant, if not otherwise employed, to assist the female in
      small, matters of the kind, so did Flanagan, in his best manner and
      kindest voice, bid her good-morning and offer to carry home the pitcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the least I may do,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;now that I&rsquo;m your fellow-servant; but
      before you go farther, lay down your burden, an&rsquo; let us chat awhile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; replied Biddy, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s little we expected ever to see your
      father&rsquo;s son goin&rsquo; to earn his bread undher another man&rsquo;s roof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! Biddy! there&rsquo;s greater wondhers in the world than that, woman
      alive! But tell me&mdash;pooh&mdash;ay, is there a thousand quarer things&mdash;but
      I say, Biddy, how do you like to&mdash;live wid this family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, troth indeed, only for the withered ould leprechaun himself, divil a
      dacenter people ever broke bread.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet, isn&rsquo;t it a wondher that the ould fellow is what he is, an&rsquo; he so
      full o&rsquo; money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Troth, there&rsquo;s one thing myself wondhers at more than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Biddy? let us hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that you could be mane an&rsquo; shabby! enough to come as a sarvint to
      ate the bread of the man that ruined yees!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Biddy,&rdquo; replied Flanagan, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad! you&rsquo;ve said it; but do you think
      that I have so bad a heart as too keep revinge in against an inimy? How
      could I go to my knees at night, if I&mdash;no, Biddy, we must be
      Christians. Well! let us drop that; so you tell me this mother an&rsquo; son are
      kind to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As good-hearted a pair as ever lived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor, of course, can&rsquo;t but be very kind to so good-looking a girl as
      you are, Biddy,&rdquo; said Bartle, with a knowing smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very kind! good-looking! ay, indeed, I&rsquo;m sure o&rsquo; that, Bartle; behave!
      an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t be gettin&rsquo; an wid any o&rsquo; your palavers. What &lsquo;ud make Connor be
      kind to the likes of me, that way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you oughtn&rsquo;t an&rsquo; mightn&rsquo;t&mdash;you&rsquo;re as good as him, if
      it goes to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yis, indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you know you&rsquo;r handsome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Handsome,&rdquo; replied the vain girl, tightening her apron-strings, and
      assuming a sly, coquettish look; &ldquo;Bartle, go &lsquo;an mind your business, and
      let me bring home my pitchers; it&rsquo;s time the breakwist was down. Sich
      nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, you&rsquo;re not, thin; you&rsquo;ve a bad leg, a bad figure, an&rsquo; a bad
      face, an&rsquo; it would be a terrible thing all out for Connor O&rsquo;Donovan to
      fall in consate wid you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, about Connor I could tell you something;&mdash;me! tut! go to the
      sarra;&mdash;faix, you don&rsquo;t know them that Connor&rsquo;s afther, nor the
      collogin&rsquo; they all had about it no longer ago than last night itself. I
      suppose they thought I was asleep, but it was like the hares, wid my eyes
      open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s a pity, Biddy, ever the same two eyes should be shut. Begad,
      myself is beginning to feel quare somehow, when I look at them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A glance of pretended incredulity was given in return, after which she
      proceeded&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bartle, don&rsquo;t be bringin&rsquo; yourself to the fair wid sich folly. My eyes is
      jist as God made them; but I can tell you that before a month o&rsquo; Sundays
      passes, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if you seen Connor married to&mdash;you
      wouldn&rsquo;t guess!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I; divil a hap&rsquo;orth I know about who he&rsquo;s courtin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No less than our great beauty, Bodagh Buie&rsquo;s daughter, Una O&rsquo;Brien. Now,
      Bartle, for goodness sake, don&rsquo;t let this cross your lips to a livin&rsquo; 
      mortal. Sure I heard him tellin&rsquo; all to the father and mother last night&mdash;they&rsquo;re
      promised to one another. Eh! blessed saints, Bartle, what ails you? you&rsquo;re
      as white as a sheet. What&rsquo;s wrong? and what did you start for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; replied Flanagan, coolly, &ldquo;but a stitch in my side. I&rsquo;m subject
      to that&mdash;it pains me very much while it lasts, and laves me face, as
      you say, the color of dimity; but about Connor, upon my throth, I&rsquo;m main
      proud to hear it; she&rsquo;s a purty girl, an&rsquo; besides he&rsquo;ll have a fortune
      that&rsquo;ll make a man of him. I am, in throth, heart proud to hear it. It&rsquo;s a
      pity Connor&rsquo;s father isn&rsquo;t as dacent as himself. Arrah, Biddy, where does
      the ould codger keep his money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little of it in the house any way&mdash;sure, whenever he scrapes a
      guinea together he&rsquo;s away wid it to the county &mdash;&mdash; county
      &mdash;&mdash; och, that countryman that keeps the money for the people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The treasurer; well, much good may his thrash do him, Biddy, that&rsquo;s the
      worst I wish him. Come now and I&rsquo;ll lave your pitchers at home, and
      remember you owe me something for this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good will, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That for one thing,&rdquo; he replied, as they went along; &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ll talk more
      about it when we have time; and I&rsquo;ll thin tell you the truth about what
      brought me to hire wid Fardorougha Donovan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having thus excited that most active principle called female curiosity,
      both entered the kitchen, where they found Connor and his mother in close
      and apparently confidential conversation&mdash;Fardorougha himself having
      as usual been abroad upon his farm for upwards of an hour before any of
      them had risen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The feelings with which they met that morning at breakfast may be easily
      understood by our readers without much assistance of ours. On the part of
      Fardorougha there was a narrow, selfish sense of exultation, if not
      triumph, at the chance that lay before his son of being able to settle
      himself independently in life, without the necessity of making any demand
      upon the hundreds which lay so safely in the keeping of the County
      Treasurer. His sordid soul was too deeply imbued with the love of money to
      perceive that what he had hitherto looked upon as a proof of parental
      affection and foresight, was nothing more than a fallacy by which he was
      led day after day farther into his prevailing vice. In other words, now
      that love for his son, and the hope of seeing him occupy a respectable
      station in society, ought to have justified the reasoning by which he had
      suffered himself to be guided, it was apparent that the prudence which he
      had still considered to be his duty as a kind parent, was nothing else
      than a mask for his own avarice. The idea, therefore, of seeing Connor
      settled without any aid from himself, filled his whole soul with a wild,
      hard satisfaction, which gave him as much delight as perhaps he was
      capable of enjoying. The advice offered to his son on the preceding night
      appeared to him a matter so reasonable in itself, and the opportunity
      offered by Una&rsquo;s attachment so well adapted for making it an instrument to
      work upon the affections of her parents, that he could not for the life of
      him perceive why they should entertain any rational objection against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The warm-hearted mother participated so largely in all that affected the
      happiness of her son, that, if we allow for the difference of sex and
      position, we might describe their feelings as bearing, in the character of
      their simple and vivid enjoyment, a very remarkable resemblance. This
      amiable woman&rsquo;s affection for Connor was reflected upon Una O&rsquo;Brien, whom
      she now most tenderly loved, not because the fair girl was beautiful, but
      because she had plighted her troth to that Son who had been during his
      whole life her own solace and delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner was the morning meal concluded, and the servants engaged at
      their respective employments, than Honor, acting probably under Connor&rsquo;s
      suggestion, resolved at once to ascertain whether her husband could so far
      overcome his parsimony as to establish their son and Una in life; that is,
      in the event of Una&rsquo;s parents opposing their marriage, and declining to
      render them any assistance. With this object in view, she told him, as he
      was throwing his great-coat over his shoulders, in order to proceed to the
      fields, that she wished to speak to him upon a matter of deep importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Fardorougha, with a hesitating shrug, &ldquo;what is it? This
      is ever an&rsquo; always the way when you want <i>money</i>; but I tell you I
      have no money. You wor born to waste and extravagance, Honor, an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s
      no curin&rsquo; you. What is it you want? an&rsquo; let me go about my business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throw that ould threadbare Cothamore off o&rsquo; you,&rdquo; replied Honor, &ldquo;and beg
      of God to give you grace to sit down, an&rsquo; have common feeling and common
      sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s money to get cloes either for yourself or Connor, there&rsquo;s no use
      in it. I needn&rsquo;t sit; you don&rsquo;t want a stitch, either of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Honor, without more ado, seized the coat, and, flinging it aside, pushed
      him over to a seat on which she forced him to sit down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As heaven&rsquo;s above me,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;I dunna what come over you at all,
      at all. Your money, your thrash, your dirt an&rsquo; filth, ever, ever, an&rsquo; for
      evermore in your thought, heart and sowl. Oh, Chierna! to think of it, an&rsquo; 
      you know there is a God above you, an&rsquo; that you must meet Him, an&rsquo; that
      widout your money too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay, the money&rsquo;s what you want to come at; but I&rsquo;ll not sit here to be
      hecthor&rsquo;d. What is it, I say again, you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fardorougha ahagur,&rdquo; continued the wife, checking herself, and addressing
      him in a kind and affectionate voice, &ldquo;maybe I was spakin&rsquo; too harsh to
      you, but sure it was an&rsquo; is for your own good. How an&rsquo; ever, I&rsquo;ll thry
      kindness, and if you have a heart at all, you can&rsquo;t but show it when you
      hear what I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, go an,&rdquo; replied the pertinacious husband; &ldquo;but&mdash;money&mdash;ay,
      ay, is there. I feel, by the way you&rsquo;re comin&rsquo; about me, that there is
      money at the bottom of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wife raised her hands and eyes to heaven, shook her head, and after a
      slight pause, in which she appeared to consider her appeal a hopeless one,
      she at length went on in an earnest but subdued and desponding spirit&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fardorougha, the time&rsquo;s now come that will show the world whether you
      love Connor or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a pin about the world; you an&rsquo; Connor know well enough that
      I love him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love for one&rsquo;s child doesn&rsquo;t come out merely in words, Fardorougha;
      actin&rsquo; for their benefit shows it better than spakin&rsquo;. Don&rsquo;t you grant
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, may be I do, and again may be I don&rsquo;t; there&rsquo;s times when the
      one&rsquo;s better than the other; but go an; may be I do grant it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now tell me where in this parish, ay, or in the next five parishes to it,
      you&rsquo;d find sich a boy for a father or mother to be proud out of, as
      Connor, your own darlin&rsquo; as you often cau him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divil a one, Honor; <i>damnho</i> to the one; I won&rsquo;t differ wid you in
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t differ wid me! the divil thank you for that. You won&rsquo;t indeed!
      but could you, I say, if you wor willin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you I could <i>not</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now there&rsquo;s sinse an&rsquo; kindness in that. Very well, you say you&rsquo;re
      gatherin&rsquo; up all the money you can for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For him&mdash;him,&rdquo; exclaimed the unconscious miser, &ldquo;why, what do you
      mane&mdash;for&mdash;well&mdash;ay&mdash;yes, yes, I did say for him; it&rsquo;s
      for him I&rsquo;m keeping it&mdash;it is, I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Fardorougha, you know he&rsquo;s ould enough to be settled in life on his
      own account, an&rsquo; you heard last night the girl he can get, if you stand to
      him, as he ought to expect from a father that loves him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, last night, thin, didn&rsquo;t I give my&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whist, ahagur! hould your tongue awhile, and let me go on. Thruth&rsquo;s best&mdash;he
      dotes on that girl to such a degree, that if he doesn&rsquo;t get her, he&rsquo;ll
      never see another happy day while he&rsquo;s alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All <i>feasthalagh</i>, Honor&mdash;that won&rsquo;t pass wid me; I know
      otherwise myself. Do you think that if I hadn&rsquo;t got you, I&rsquo;d been unhappy
      four-an&rsquo;-twenty hours, let alone my whole life? I tell you that&rsquo;s <i>feasthalagh</i>,
      an&rsquo; won&rsquo;t pass. He wouldn&rsquo;t eat an ounce the less if he was never to get
      her. You seen the breakfast he made this mornin&rsquo;; I didn&rsquo;t begrudge it to
      him, but may I never stir if that Flanagan wouldn&rsquo;t ate a horse behind the
      saddle; he has a stomach that&rsquo;d require a king&rsquo;s ransom to keep it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know nothing of what I&rsquo;m spakin&rsquo; about,&rdquo; replied his wife. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t
      <i>Una dhas dhun</i> O&rsquo;Brien in my best days; an&rsquo; be the vestment, you
      warn&rsquo;t Connor, that has more feelin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; spirit, an&rsquo; generosity in the
      nail of his little finger than ever you had in your whole carcass. I tell
      you if he doesn&rsquo;t get married to that girl he&rsquo;ll break his heart. Now how
      can he marry her except you take a good farm for him, and stock it
      dacently, so that he may have a home sich as she desarves to bring her
      to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know but they&rsquo;ll give her a fortune when they find her bent on
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s not unpossible,&rdquo; said the wife, immediately changing her
      tactics, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not impossible, but I can tell you it&rsquo;s very unlikely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best way, then, in my opinion, &lsquo;ud be to spake to Connor about
      breaking it to the family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s fair enough,&rdquo; said the wife. &ldquo;I wondher myself I didn&rsquo;t think
      of it, but the time was so short since last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is short,&rdquo; replied the miser, &ldquo;far an&rsquo; away too short to expect any
      one to make up their mind about it. Let them not be rash themselves
      aither, for I tell you that when people marry in haste, they&rsquo;re apt to
      have time enough to repint at laysure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but Fardorougha acushla, now hear me, throth it&rsquo;s thruth and sinse
      what you say; but still, avourneen, listen; now set in case that the
      Bodagh and his wife don&rsquo;t consint to their marriage, or to do anything for
      them, won&rsquo;t you take them a farm and stock it bravely? Think of poor
      Connor, the darlin&rsquo; fine fellow that he is. Oh, thin, Saver above, but
      it&rsquo;s he id go to the well o&rsquo; the world&rsquo;s end to ase you, if your little
      finger only ached. He would, or for myself, and yet his own father to
      trate him wid sich&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was in vain she attempted to proceed; the subject was one in which her
      heart felt too deep an interest to be discussed without tears. A brief
      silence ensued, during which Fardorougha moved uneasily on his seat, took
      the tongs, and mechanically mended the fire, and, peering at his wife with
      a countenance twitched as if by <i>tic douloureux</i>, stared round the
      house with a kind of stupid wonder, rose up, then sat instantly down, and
      in fact exhibited many of those unintelligible and uncouth movements,
      which, in person of his cast, may be properly termed the hieroglyphics of
      human action, under feelings that cannot be deciphered either by those on
      whom they operate, or by those who witness them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Connor is all you say, an&rsquo; more&mdash;an&rsquo; more&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;a
      rash act is the worst thing he could do. It&rsquo;s betther, Honor, to spake to
      him as I sed, about lettin&rsquo; the matther be known to Una&rsquo;s family out of
      hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And thin, if they refuse, you can show them a ginerous example, by
      puttin&rsquo; them into a dacent farm. Will you promise me that, Fardorougha? If
      you do, all&rsquo;s right, for they&rsquo;re not livin&rsquo; that ever knew you to braak
      your word or your promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make no promise, Honor; I&rsquo;ll make no promise; but let the other plan
      be tried first. Now don&rsquo;t be pressin&rsquo; me; he is a noble boy, and would, as
      you say, thravel round the earth to keep my little finger from pain; but
      let me alone about it now&mdash;let me alone about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, though slight encouragement, was still, in Honor&rsquo;s opinion, quite as
      much as, if not more, than she expected. Without pressing him, therefore,
      too strongly at that moment, she contented herself with a full-length
      portrait of their son, drawn with all the skill of a mother who knew, if
      her husband&rsquo;s heart could be touched at all, those points at which she
      stood the greatest chance of finding it accessible.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few days after this the subject of Connor&rsquo;s love was permitted to
      lie undebated, in the earnest hope that Fardorougha&rsquo;s heart might have
      caught some slight spark of natural affection from the conversation which
      had taken place between him and Honor. They waited, consequently, with
      patience for some manifestation on his part of a better feeling, and
      flattered themselves that his silence proceeded from the struggle which
      they knew a man of his disposition must necessarily feel in working up his
      mind to any act requiring him to part with that which he loved better than
      life, his money. The ardent temperament of Connor, however, could ill
      brook the pulseless indifference of the old man; with much difficulty,
      therefore, was he induced to wait a whole week for the issue, though
      sustained by the mother&rsquo;s assurance, that, in consequence of the
      impression left on her by their last conversation, she was certain the
      father, if not urged beyond his wish, would declare himself willing to
      provide for them. A week, however, elapsed, and Fardorougha moved on in
      the same hard and insensible spirit which was usual to him, wholly
      engrossed by money, and never, either directly or indirectly, appearing to
      remember that the happiness and welfare of his son were at stake, or
      depending upon the determination to which he might come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another half week passed, during which Connor had made two unsuccessful
      attempts to see Una, in order that some fixed plan of intercourse might be
      established between them, at least until his father&rsquo;s ultimate resolution
      on the subject proposed to him should be known. He now felt deeply
      distressed, and regretted that the ardor of his attachment had so far
      borne him away during their last meeting, that he had forgotten to concert
      measures with Una for their future interviews.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had often watched about her father&rsquo;s premises from a little before
      twilight until the whole family had gone to bed, yet without any chance
      either of conversing with her, or of letting her know that he was in the
      neighborhood. He had gone to chapel, too, with the hope of seeing her, or
      snatching a hasty opportunity of exchanging a word or two, if possible;
      but to his astonishment she had not attended mass&mdash;an omission of
      duty of which she had not been guilty for the last three years. What,
      therefore, was to be done? For him to be detected lurking about the
      Bodagh&rsquo;s house might create suspicion, especially after their interview in
      the garden, which very probably had, through the officiousness of the
      servants, been communicated to her parents. In a matter of such difficulty
      he bethought him of a confidant, and the person to whom the necessity of
      the ease directed him was Bartle Flanagan. Bartle, indeed, ever since he
      entered into his father&rsquo;s service, had gained rapidly upon Connor&rsquo;s good
      will, and on one or two occasions well-nigh succeeded in drawing from him
      a history of the mutual attachment which subsisted between him and Una.
      His good humor, easy language, and apparent friendship for young
      O&rsquo;Donovan, together with his natural readiness of address, or, if you
      will, of manner, all marked him out as admirably qualified to act as a
      confidant in a matter which required the very tact and talent he
      possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow,&rdquo; thought Connor to himself, &ldquo;it will make him feel more like
      one of the family than a servant. If he can think that he&rsquo;s trated as my
      friend and companion, he may forget that he&rsquo;s ating the bread of the very
      man that drove him an&rsquo; his to destruction. Ay, an&rsquo; if we&rsquo;re married, I&rsquo;m
      not sure but I&rsquo;ll have him to give me away too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This resolution of permitting Flanagan to share his confidence had been
      come to by Connor upon the day subsequent to that on which he had last
      tried to see Una. After his return home, disappointment on one hand, and
      his anxiety concerning his father&rsquo;s liberality on the other, together with
      the delight arising from the certainty of being beloved, all kept his mind
      in a tumult, and permitted him to sleep but little. The next day he
      decided on admitting Bartle to his confidence, and reposing this solemn
      trust to his integrity. He was lying on his back in the meadow&mdash;for
      they had been ricking the hay from the lapcocks&mdash;when that delicious
      languor which arises from the three greatest provocatives to slumber, want
      of rest, fatigue, and heat, so utterly overcame him, that, forgetting his
      love, and all the anxiety arising from it, he fell into a dreamless and
      profound sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this state he was aroused after about an hour by the pressure of
      something sharp and painful against his side, near the region of the
      heart, and on looking up, he discovered Bartle Flanagan standing over him
      with pitchfork in his hand, one end of which was pressed against his
      breast, as if he had been in the act of driving it forward into his body.
      His face was pale, his dark brows frightfully contracted, and his teeth
      apparently set together, as if working over some fearful determination.
      When Connor awoke, Flanagan broke out into a laugh that no language could
      describe. The character of mirth which he wished to throw into his face,
      jarred so terrifically with his demoniacal expression when first seen by
      Connor, that, even unsuspecting as he was, he started up with alarm, and
      asked Flanagan what was the matter. Flanagan, however, laughed on&mdash;peal
      after peal succeeded&mdash;he tossed the pitchfork aside, and, clapping
      both his hands upon his face, continued the paroxysms until he recovered
      his composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick, I&rsquo;m as wake as a child wid laughin&rsquo;; but, Lord
      bless us, after all, Connor, what is a man&rsquo;s life worth whin he has an
      enemy near him? There was I, ticklin&rsquo; you wid the pitchfork, strivin&rsquo; to
      waken you, and one inch of it would have baked your bread for life. Didn&rsquo;t
      you feel me, Connor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divil a bit, till the minute before I ris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the divil a purtier jig you ever danced in your life; wait till I
      show you how your left toe wint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He accordingly lay down and illustrated the pretended action, after which
      he burst out into another uncontrollable fit of mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas just for all the world,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as if I had tied a string to
      your toe, for you groaned an&rsquo; grunted, an&rsquo; went on like I dunna what; but,
      Connor, what makes you so sleepy to-day as well as on Monday last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the very thing,&rdquo; replied the unsuspicious and candid young man,
      &ldquo;that I wanted to spake to you about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! about sleepin&rsquo; in the meadows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divil a bit o&rsquo; that, Bartle, not a morsel of sleepin&rsquo; in the meadows is
      consarned in what I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to mintion to you. Bartle, didn&rsquo;t you tell me,
      the day you hired wid my father, that you wor in love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did, Connor, I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so am I; but do you know who I&rsquo;m in love with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How the divil, man, could I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no swerin&rsquo;, Bartle; keep the commandments, my boy. I&rsquo;ll tell you in
      the mane time, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s more than you did me, you
      close-mouth-is-a-sign-of-a-wise-head spalpeen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever hear tell of one <i>Colleen dhas dhun</i> as she&rsquo;s called,
      known by the name Una or Oona O&rsquo;Brien, daughter to one Bodagh Buie
      O&rsquo;Brien, the richest man, barin&rsquo; a born gentleman, in the three parishes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All very fair, Connor, for you or any one else to be in love wid her&mdash;ay,
      man alive, for myself, if it goes to that&mdash;but, but, Connor,
      avouchal, are you sure that sure you&rsquo;ll bring her to be in love wid you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bartle,&rdquo; said Connor, seriously and after a sudden change in his whole
      manner, &ldquo;in this business I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to trate you as a friend, and a
      brother. She loves me, Bartle, and a solemn promise of marriage has passed
      between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor,&rdquo; said Bartle, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s wondherful, it&rsquo;s wondherful! you couldn&rsquo;t
      believe what a fool I am&mdash;fool! no, but a faint-hearted, cowardly
      villain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mane, Bartle? what the dickens are you drivin&rsquo; at!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Driven at! whenever I happen to have an opportunity of makin&rsquo; a drive
      that id&mdash;but! I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; balderdash. Do you see here, Connor,&rdquo; said
      he, putting his hand to his neck, &ldquo;do you see here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure I do. Well, what about there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be my sowl, I&rsquo;m very careful of&mdash;but!&mdash;sure I may as well tell
      you the whole truth&mdash;I sed I was in love; well, man, that was thrue,
      an&rsquo;,&rdquo; he added in a low, pithy whisper, &ldquo;I was near&mdash;no, Connor, I
      won&rsquo;t but go an; it&rsquo;s enough for you to know that I was an&rsquo; am in love,
      an&rsquo; that it&rsquo;ll go hard wid me if ever any one else is married to the girl
      I&rsquo;m in love wid. Now that my business is past, let me hear yours, poor
      fellow, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m devilish glad to know, Connor, that&mdash;that&mdash;why,
      tunder an&rsquo; ouns, that you&rsquo;re not as I am. Be the crass that saved us,
      Connor, I&rsquo;m glad of that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, love will set you mad, Bartle, if you don&rsquo;t take care of yourself;
      an&rsquo;, faith, I dunna but it may do the same with myself, if I&rsquo;m
      disappointed. However, the truth is, you must sarve me in this business. I
      struv to see her twiste, but couldn&rsquo;t, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m afraid of bein&rsquo; seen spyin&rsquo; 
      about their place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth is, Connor, you want to make me a go-between&mdash;a blackfoot;
      very well, I&rsquo;ll do that same on your account, an&rsquo; do it well, too, I
      hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was then arranged that Flanagan, who was personally known to some of
      the Bodagli&rsquo;s servants, should avail himself of that circumstance, and
      contrive to gain an interview with Una, in order to convey her a letter
      from O&rsquo;Donovan. He was further enjoined by no means to commit it to the
      hands of any person save those of Una herself, and, in the event of his
      not being able to see her, then the letter was to be returned to Connor.
      If he succeeded, however, in delivering it, he was to await an answer,
      provided she found an opportunity of sending one; if not, she was to
      inform Connor, through Flanagan, at what time and place he could see her.
      This arrangement having been made, Connor immediately wrote the letter,
      and, after having despatched Flanagan upon his errand, set himself to
      perform, by his individual labor, the task which his father had portioned
      out for both. Ere Bartle&rsquo;s return, Fardorougha came to inspect their
      progress in the meadow, and, on finding that the servant was absent, he
      inquired sharply into the cause of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone on a message for me,&rdquo; replied Connor, with the utmost
      frankness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s a bad way for him to mind his business,&rdquo; said the father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have the task that you set both of us finished,&rdquo; replied the son,
      &ldquo;so that you&rsquo;ll lose nothin&rsquo; by his absence, at all events.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wrong, Connor, it&rsquo;s wrong; where did you sind him to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Bodagh Buie&rsquo;s wid a letter to Una.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a waste of time, an&rsquo; a loss of work; about that business I have
      something to say to your mother an&rsquo; you to&mdash;night, afther the supper,
      when the rest goes to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, father,you&rsquo;ll do the dacent thing still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but I hope, son, you&rsquo;ll do the wise thing still; how&mdash;an&mdash;ever
      let me alone now; if you expect me to do anything, you mustn&rsquo;t drive me as
      your mother does. To-night we&rsquo;ll make up a plan that&rsquo;ll outdo Bodagh Buie.
      Before you come home, Connor, throw a stone or two in that gap, to prevent
      the cows from gettin&rsquo; into the hay; it won&rsquo;t cost you much throuble. But,
      Connor, did you ever see sich a gut as Bartle has? He&rsquo;ll brake me out
      o&rsquo;house an&rsquo; home feedin&rsquo; him; he has a stomach for ten-penny-nails; be my
      word it &lsquo;ud be a charity to give him a dose of oak bark to make him
      dacent; he&rsquo;s a divil at aitin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; little good may it do him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hour of supper arrived without Bartle&rsquo;s returning, and Connor&rsquo;s
      impatience began to overcome him, when Fardorougha, for the first time,
      introduced the subject which lay nearest his son&rsquo;s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinkin&rsquo; of this affair with Una O&rsquo;Brien;
      an&rsquo; in my opinion there&rsquo;s but one way out of it; but if you&rsquo;re a fool an&rsquo; 
      stand in your own light, it&rsquo;s not my fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the way, father?&rdquo; inquired Connor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very same I tould your mother an&rsquo; you before&mdash;run away wid her&mdash;I
      mane make a runaway match of it&mdash;then refuse to marry her unless they
      come down wid the money. You know afther runnin&rsquo; away wid you nobody else
      ever would marry her; so that rather than see their child disgraced, never
      fear but they&rsquo;ll pay down on the nail, or maybe bring you both to live wid
      &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sowl to glory, Fardorougha,&rdquo; said the wife, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;re a bigger an&rsquo; 
      cunninner ould rogue than I ever took you for! By the scapular upon me, if
      I had known how you&rsquo;d turn out, the sorra carry the ring ever you&rsquo;d put on
      my finger!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Connor, &ldquo;I must be disobedient to you in this at all
      events. It&rsquo;s plain you&rsquo;ll do nothing for us; so there&rsquo;s no use in sayin&rsquo; 
      anything more about it. I have no manes of supportin&rsquo; her, an&rsquo; I swear
      I&rsquo;ll never bring her to poverty. If I had money to carry me, I&rsquo;d go to
      America an&rsquo; thry my fortune there; but I have not. Father, it&rsquo;s too hard
      that you should stand in my way when you could so easily make me happy.
      Who have you sich a right to assist as your son&mdash;your only son, an&rsquo; 
      your only child too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was spoken in a tone of respect and sorrow at once impressive and
      affectionate. His fine features were touched with something beyond sadness
      or regret, and, as the tears stood in his eyes, it was easy to see that he
      felt much more deeply for his father&rsquo;s want of principle than for anything
      connected with his own hopes and prospects. In fact, the tears that rolled
      silently down his cheeks were the tears of shame and sorrow for a parent
      who could thus school him to an act of such unparalleled baseness. As it
      was, the genius of the miser felt rebuked by the natural delicacy and
      honor of his son; the old man therefore shrunk back abashed, confused, and
      moved at the words which he had heard&mdash;simple and inoffensive though
      they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fardorougha,&rdquo; said the wife, wiping her eyes, that were kindling into
      indignation, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re now married goin&rsquo; an&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, mother,&rdquo; said Connor, &ldquo;the less we say about it now the better&mdash;with
      my own good will I&rsquo;ll never speak on the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, avourneen,&rdquo; replied the mother; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re right; I&rsquo;ll say
      nothing&mdash;God sees it&rsquo;s no use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you have me do?&rdquo; said the old man, rising and walking&rsquo; about
      in unusual distress and agitation; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know me&mdash;I can&rsquo;t do it&mdash;I
      cant do it. You say, Honor, I don&rsquo;t care about him&mdash;I&rsquo;d give him my
      blood&mdash;I&rsquo;d give him my blood to save a hair of his head. My life an&rsquo; 
      happiness depinds on him; but who knows how he an&rsquo; his wife might
      mismanage that money if they got it&mdash;both young an&rsquo; foolish? It
      wasn&rsquo;t for nothing it came into my mind what I&rsquo;m afeard will happen to me
      yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what was that, Fardorougha?&rdquo; asked the wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sich foreknowledge doesn&rsquo;t come for nothing, Honor. I&rsquo;ve had it an&rsquo; felt
      it hangin&rsquo; over me this many a long day, that I&rsquo;d come to starvation yit;
      an&rsquo; I see, that if you force me to do as you wish, that it &lsquo;ill happen.
      I&rsquo;m as sure of it as that I stand before you. I&rsquo;m an unfortunate man wid
      sich a fate before me; an&rsquo; yet I&rsquo;d shed my blood for my boy&mdash;I would,
      an&rsquo; he ought to know that I would; but he wouldn&rsquo;t ax me to starve for him&mdash;would
      you, Connor, avick machree, would you ax your father to starve? I&rsquo;m
      unhappy&mdash;unhappy&mdash;an&rsquo; my heart&rsquo;s breakin&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s voice failed him as he uttered the last words; for the
      conflict which he felt evidently convulsed his whole frame. He wiped his
      eyes, and, again sitting down, he wept bitterly and in silence, for many
      minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      A look of surprise, compassion, and deep distress passed between Connor
      and his mother. The latter also was very much affected, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fardorougha, dear, maybe I spake sometimes too cross to you; but if I do,
      God above knows it&rsquo;s not that I bear you ill will, but bekase I&rsquo;m troubled
      about poor Connor. But I hope I won&rsquo;t spake angry to you again; at all
      events, if I do, renumber it&rsquo;s only the mother pladin&rsquo; for her son&mdash;the
      only son an&rsquo; child that God was plazed to sind her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; added Connor, also deeply moved, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t distress yourself about
      me&mdash;don&rsquo;t, father dear. Let things take their chance; but come or go
      what will, any good fortune that might happen me wouldn&rsquo;t be sweet if it
      came by givin&rsquo; you a sore heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the barking of the dog gave notice of approaching
      footsteps; and in a few moments the careless whistle of Bartle Flanagan
      was heard within a few yards of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Bartle,&rdquo; said Connor; &ldquo;maybe, father, his answer may throw some
      light upon the business. At any rate, there&rsquo;s no secret in it; we&rsquo;ll all
      hear what news he brings us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had scarcely concluded when the latch was lifted, but Bartle could not
      enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s locked and bolted,&rdquo; said Fardorougha; &ldquo;as he sleeps in the barn I
      forgot that he was to come in here any more to-night&mdash;open it,
      Connor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the sake of all the money you keep in the house, father,&rdquo; said
      Connor, smiling, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s hardly worth your while to be so timorous; but God
      help the county treasurer if he forgot to bar his door&mdash;Asy, Bartle,
      I&rsquo;m openin&rsquo; it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flanagan immediately entered, and, with all the importance of a confidant,
      took his seat at the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Bartle,&rdquo; said Connor, &ldquo;what news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the boy get his supper first,&rdquo; said Honor; &ldquo;Bartle, you must be
      starved wid hunger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, I&rsquo;m middlin&rsquo; well, I thank you, that same way,&rdquo; replied Bartle;
      &ldquo;divil a one o&rsquo; me but&rsquo;s as ripe for my supper as a July cherry; an&rsquo; wid
      the blessin&rsquo; o&rsquo; Heaven upon my endayvors I&rsquo;ll soon show you what good
      execution is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A deep groan from Fardorougha gave back a fearful echo to the truth of
      this formidable annunciation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you well, Fardorougha?&rdquo; asked Bartle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throth I&rsquo;m not, Bartle; never was more uncomfortable in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flanagan immediately commenced his supper, which consisted of flummery and
      new milk&mdash;a luxury among the lower ranks which might create envy in
      an epicure. As he advanced in the work of destruction, the gray eye of
      Fardorougha, which followed every spoonful that entered his mouth,
      scintillated like that of a cat when rubbed down the back, though from a
      directly opposite feeling. He turned and twisted on the chair, and looked
      from his wife to his son, then turned up his eyes, and appeared to feel as
      if a dagger entered his heart with every additional dig of Bartle&rsquo;s spoon
      into the flummery. The son and wife smiled at each other; for they could
      enjoy those petty sufferings of Fardorougha with a great deal of
      good-humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bartle,&rdquo; said Connor, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divil a word worth telling; at laste that I can hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mane from Bodagh Buie&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bartle stared at him; &ldquo;Bodagh Buie&rsquo;s!&mdash;what do I know about Bodagh
      Buie? are you ravin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bartle,&rdquo; said Connor, smiling, &ldquo;my father and mother knows all about it&mdash;an&rsquo; 
      about your going to Una with the letter. I have no secrets from them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoot toot! That&rsquo;s a horse of another color; but you wouldn&rsquo;t have me,
      widout knowin&rsquo; as much, to go to betray trust. In the mane time, I may as
      well finish my supper before I begin to tell you what-som-ever I happen to
      know about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another deep groan from Fardorougha followed the last observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the work of demolition ceased, and after Honor had put past the
      empty dish, Bartle, having wiped his mouth, and uttered a hiccup or two,
      thus commenced to dole out his intelligence:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whin I wint to the Bodagh&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Bartle, &ldquo;it was wid great schamin&rsquo; an&rsquo; 
      throuble I got a sight of Miss Una at all, in regard of &mdash;(hiccup)&mdash;in
      regard of her not knowin&rsquo; that there was any sich message for her&mdash;(hiccup).
      But happenin&rsquo; to know Sally Laffan, I made bould to go into the kitchen to
      ax, you know, how was her aunt&rsquo;s family up in Skelgy, when who should I
      find before me in it but Sally an&rsquo; Miss Una&mdash;(hiccup). (Saver of
      earth this night! from Fardorougha.) Of coorse I shook hands wid her&mdash;wid
      Sally, I mane; an&rsquo;, &lsquo;Sally,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;I was sent in wid a message from the
      masther to you; he&rsquo;s in the haggard an&rsquo; wants you.&rsquo; So, begad, on&mdash;-(hiccup)
      out she goes, an&rsquo; the coast bein&rsquo; clear, &lsquo;Miss Una,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;here&rsquo;s a
      scrap of a letther from Misther Connor O&rsquo;Donovan; read it, and if you can
      write him an answer, do; if you haven&rsquo;t time say whatever you have to say
      by me.&rsquo; She go&mdash;(hiccup) she got all colors when I handed it to her;
      an&rsquo; run away, say&mdash;in&rsquo; to me, &lsquo;wait for a while, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t go till I
      see you.&rsquo; In a minute or two Sally comes in agin as mad as the dickens wid
      me, &lsquo;The curse o&rsquo; the crows an&rsquo; you!&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;why did you make me run a
      fool&rsquo;s erran&rsquo; for no rason? The masther wasn&rsquo;t in the haggard, an&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t
      want me good or bad.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bartle,&rdquo; said the impatient lover, &ldquo;pass all that over for the present,
      an&rsquo; let us know the answer, if she sent any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sent any! be my sowl, she did so! Afther readin&rsquo; your letther, an&rsquo; 
      findin&rsquo; that she could depind on me, she said that for fear of any remarks
      bein&rsquo; made about my waitin&rsquo;, espishally as I live at present in this
      family, it would be better she thought to answer it by word o&rsquo; mouth.
      &lsquo;Tell him,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;that I didn&rsquo;t think he wa&mdash;(hiccup) (Queen o&rsquo; 
      heaven!) was so dull an&rsquo; ignorant o&rsquo; the customs of the country, as not to
      know that whin young people want to see one another they stay away from
      mass wid an expectation that&rsquo;&mdash;begad, I disremimber exactly her own
      words; but it was as much as to say that she staid at home on last Sunday
      expectin&rsquo; to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but Bartle, what else?&mdash;short an&rsquo; sweet, man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, she&rsquo;ll meet you on next Thursday night, God willin&rsquo;, in the same
      place; an&rsquo; whin I axed her where, she said you knew it yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; is that all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not all; she sed it &lsquo;ud be better to mention the thing to her
      father. Afther thinkin&rsquo; it over she says, &lsquo;as your father has the na&mdash;(hiccup)
      &lsquo;(Saints above!) the name of being so rich, she doesn&rsquo;t know if a friend
      &lsquo;ud interfere but his consint might be got;&rsquo; an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s all I have to say
      about it, barrin&rsquo; that she&rsquo;s a very purty girl, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d advise you not to
      be too sure of her yet, Bartle. So now I&rsquo;m for the barn&mdash;Good night,
      Far&mdash;(hiccup) (at my cost, you do it!) Fardorougha.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose and proceeded to his sleeping&mdash;place in the barn, whither
      Connor, who was struck by his manner, accompanied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bartle,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Donovan, &ldquo;did you take anything since I saw you last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a share of two naggins wid my brother Antony at Peggy Finigan&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I noticed it upon you,&rdquo; observed Connor; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think they did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; if they did, too, it&rsquo;s not high thrason, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but, Bartle, I&rsquo;m obliged to you. You&rsquo;ve acted as a friend to me, an&rsquo; 
      I won&rsquo;t forget it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; I&rsquo;m so much obliged to you, Connor, that I&rsquo;ll remimber your employin&rsquo; 
      me in this the longest day I have to live. But, Connor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Bartle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d take the sacrament, that, after all, a ring you&rsquo;ll never put on her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what makes you think so, Bartle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&mdash;I do&mdash;(hiccup) don&rsquo;t know; but somehow something or
      another tells it to me that you won&rsquo;t; others is fond of her, I suppose,
      as well as yourself; and of coorse they&rsquo;ll stand betune you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but I&rsquo;m sure of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not; wait till I see you man and wife, an&rsquo; thin I&rsquo;ll say so.
      Here&rsquo;s myself, Bartle, is in love, an&rsquo; dhough I don&rsquo;t expect ever the girl
      will or would marry me, be the crass of heaven, no other man will have
      her. Now, how do you know but you may have some one like me&mdash;like me,
      Connor, to stand against you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bartle,&rdquo; said Connor, laughing, &ldquo;your head&rsquo;s a little moidher&rsquo;d; give me
      your hand; whish! the devil take you, man! don&rsquo;t wring my fingers off. Say
      your prayers, Bartle, an&rsquo; go to sleep. I say agin I won&rsquo;t forget your
      kindness to me this night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flanagan had now deposited himself upon his straw bed, and, after having
      tugged the bedclothes about him, said, in the relaxed, indolent voice of a
      man about to sleep,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, Connor; throth my head&rsquo;s a little soft to-night&mdash;good
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, Bartle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I stand to you to-night? Very well&mdash;goo&mdash;(hiccup) good
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On Connor&rsquo;s return, a serious conclave was held upon the best mode of
      procedure in a manner which presented difficulties that appeared to be
      insurmountable. The father, seizing upon the advice transmitted by Una
      herself, as that which he had already suggested, insisted that the most
      judicious course was to propose for her openly, and without appearing to
      feel that there was any inferiority on the part of Connor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they talk about wealth, Connor,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;say that you are my son,
      an&rsquo; that&mdash;that&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;I&rsquo;m too poor for such a boast,
      but say that you will be able to take good care of anything you get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the door, which Connor had not bolted, as his father would
      have done, opened, and Bartle, wrapped in the treble folds of a winnow&mdash;cloth,
      made a distant appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg pardon, Connor; I forgot to say that Una&rsquo;s brother, the young priest
      out o&rsquo; Maynooth, will be at home from his uncle&rsquo;s, where it appears he is
      at present; an&rsquo; Miss Una would wish that the proposal &lsquo;ud be made while
      he&rsquo;s at his father&rsquo;s. She says he&rsquo;ll stand her friend, come or go what
      will. I forgot, begad, to mintion it before&mdash;so beg pardon, an&rsquo; 
      wishes you all good&mdash;night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This information tended to confirm them in the course recommended by
      Fardorougha. It was accordingly resolved upon that he (Fardorougha)
      himself should wait upon Bodagh Buie, and in the name of his son formally
      propose for the hand of his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      To effect this, however, was a matter of no ordinary difficulty, as they
      apprehended that the Bodagh and his wife would recoil with indignation at
      the bare notion of even condescending to discuss a topic which, in all
      probability, they would consider as an insult. Not, after all, that there
      existed, according to the opinion of their neighbors, such a vast
      disparity in the wealth of each; on the contrary, many were heard to
      assert, that of the two Fardorougha had the heavier purse. His character,
      however, was held in such abhorrence by all who knew him, and he ranked,
      in point of personal respectability and style of living, so far beneath
      the Bodagh, that we question if any ordinary occurrence could be supposed
      to fall upon the people with greater amazement than a marriage, or the
      report of a marriage, between any member of the two families. The
      O&rsquo;Donovans felt, however, that it was better to make the experiment
      already agreed on, than longer to remain in a state of uncertainty about
      it. Should it fail, the position of the lovers, though perhaps rendered
      somewhat less secure, would be such as to suggest, as far as they
      themselves were concerned, the necessity of a more prompt and effectual
      course of action. Fardorougha expressed his intention of opening the
      matter on the following day; but his wife, with a better knowledge of
      female character, deemed it more judicious to defer it until after the
      interview which was to take place between Connor and Una on the succeeding
      Thursday. It might be better, for instance, to make the proposal first to
      Mrs. O&rsquo;Brien herself, or, on the other hand, to the Bodagh; but touching
      that and other matters relating to what was proposed to be done, Una&rsquo;s
      opinion and advice might be necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little passed, therefore, worthy of note, during the intermediate time,
      except a short conversation between Bartle and Connor on the following
      day, as they returned to the field from dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bartle,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;you wor a little soft last night; or rather a
      good deal so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, no doubt o&rsquo; that&mdash;but when a man meets an old acquaintance or
      two, they don&rsquo;t like to refuse a thrate. I fell in wid three or four boys&mdash;all
      friends o&rsquo; mine, an&rsquo; we had a sup on account o&rsquo; what&rsquo;s expected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he uttered these words, he looked at Connor with an eye which seemed to
      say&mdash;you are not in a certain secret with which I am acquainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; replied Connor, &ldquo;what do you mane, Bartle? I thought you were with
      your brother&mdash;at laste you tould me so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flanagan started on hearing this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wid my brother,&rdquo; said he&mdash;&ldquo;why, I&mdash;I&mdash;what else could I
      tell you? He was along wid the boys when I met them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Took a sup on account o&rsquo; what&rsquo;s expected!&mdash;an&rsquo; what&rsquo;s the manin&rsquo;o&rsquo; 
      that, Bartle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what would it mane&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;your marriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; thunder an&rsquo; fury?&rdquo; exclaimed Connor, his eyes gleaming; &ldquo;did you go
      to betray trust, an&rsquo; mintion Una&rsquo;s name an&rsquo; mine, afther what I tould
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish, Connor,&rdquo; replied Flanagan; &ldquo;is it mad you&rsquo;d have me to
      be? I said there was something expected soon, that &lsquo;ud surprise them; and
      when they axed me what it was&mdash;honor bright! I gave them a knowin&rsquo; 
      wink, but said notion&rsquo;. Eh! was that breakin&rsquo; trust? Arrah, be me sowl,
      Connor, you don&rsquo;t trate me well by the words you spoke this blessed
      minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; how does it come, Bartle, my boy, that you had one story last night,
      an&rsquo; another to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix, very aisily, bekase I forget what I sed last night&mdash;for sure
      enough I was more cut than you thought&mdash;but didn&rsquo;t I keep it well in
      before the ould couple?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did fairly enough; I grant that&mdash;but the moment you got into the
      barn a blind man could see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bekase I didn&rsquo;t care a button wanst I escaped from the eye of your
      father; anyhow, bad luck to it for whiskey; I have a murdherin&rsquo; big
      heddick all day afther it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad weed, Bartle, and the less a man has to do with it, the less
      he&rsquo;ll be throubled afther wid a sore head or a sore conscience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor, divil a one, but you&rsquo;re the moral of a good boy; I dunna a fault
      you have but one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, let us hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you some day, but not now, not now&mdash;but I will tell you&mdash;an&rsquo; 
      I&rsquo;ll let you know the raison thin that I don&rsquo;t mintion it now; in the mane
      time I&rsquo;ll sit down an take a smoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A smoke! why, I never knew you smoked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I, myself, till last night. This tindher&mdash;box I was made a
      present of to light my pipe, when not near a coal. Begad, now that I think
      of it, I suppose it was smokin&rsquo; that knocked me up so much last night, an&rsquo; 
      mide my head so sick to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It helped it, I&rsquo;ll engage; if you will take my advice, it&rsquo;s a custom you
      won&rsquo;t larn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a good deal to throuble me, Connor; you know I have; an&rsquo; what we
      are brought down to now; I have more nor you&rsquo;d believe to think of; as
      much, any way, as&rsquo;ll make this box an&rsquo; steel useful, I hope, when I&rsquo;m
      frettin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flanagan spoke truth, in assuring Connor that the apology given for his
      intoxication on the preceding night had escaped his memory. It was
      fortunate for him, indeed, that O&rsquo;Donovan, like all candid and ingenuous
      persons, was utterly devoid of suspicion, otherwise he might have
      perceived, by the discrepancy in the two accounts, as well as by
      Flanagan&rsquo;s confusion, that he was a person in whom it might not be prudent
      to entrust much confidence.

    <h2>
      PART III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The tryste between Connor and Una was held at the same place and hour as
      before, and so rapid a progress had love made in each of their hearts,
      that we question if the warmth of their interview, though tender and
      innocent, would be apt to escape the censure of our stricter readers. Both
      were depressed by the prospect that lay before them, for Connor frankly
      assured her that he feared no earthly circumstances could ever soften his
      father&rsquo;s heart so far as to be prevailed upon to establish him in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then can I do, my darling Una? If your father and mother won&rsquo;t
      consent&mdash;as I fear they won&rsquo;t&mdash;am I to bring you into the
      miserable cabin of a day laborer? for to this the son of a man so wealthy
      as my father is, must sink. No, Una dear, I have sworn never to bring you
      to poverty, and I will not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor,&rdquo; she replied somewhat gravely, &ldquo;I thought you had formed a
      different opinion of me. You know but little of your own Una&rsquo;s heart, if
      you think she wouldn&rsquo;t live with you in a cabin a thousand and a thousand
      times sooner than she would live with any other in a palace. I love you
      for your own sake, Connor; but it appears you don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Woman can never bear to have her love undervalued, nor the moral dignity
      of a passion which can sacrifice all worldly and selfish considerations to
      its own purity and attachment, unappreciated. When she uttered the last
      words, therefore, tears of bitter sorrow, mingled with offended pride,
      came to her aid. She sobbed for some moments, and again went on to
      reproach him with forming so unfair an estimate of her affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I repeat that I loved you for yourself only, Connor, and think of what I
      would feel, if you refused to spend your life in a cottage with me. If I
      thought you wished to marry me, not because I am Una O&rsquo;Brien, but the
      daughter of a wealthy man, my heart would break, and if I thought you were
      not true&mdash;minded, and pure&mdash;hearted, and honorable, I would
      rather be dead than united to you at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you so well, and so much, Una, that I doubt I&rsquo;m not worthy of you&mdash;and
      it&rsquo;s fear of seeing you brought down to daily labor that&rsquo;s crushing and
      breaking my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, dear Connor&mdash;what is there done by any cottager&rsquo;s wife that I
      don&rsquo;t do every day of my life? Do you think my mother lets me pass my time
      in idleness, or that I myself could bear to be unemployed even if she did;
      I can milk, make butter, spin, sew, wash, knit, and clean a kitchen; why,
      you have no notion,&rdquo; she added, with a smile, &ldquo;what a clever cottager&rsquo;s
      wife I&rsquo;d make!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Una,&rdquo; said Connor, now melting into tenderness greater than he had
      ever before felt; &ldquo;Una dear, it&rsquo;s useless&mdash;it&rsquo;s useless&mdash;I
      can&rsquo;t, no, I couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;and I will not live without you, even if we
      were to beg together&mdash;but what is to be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, while my brother John is at home, is the time to propose it to my
      father and mother who look upon him with eyes of such affection and
      delight that I am half inclined to think their consent may be gained.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe, darling, his consent will be as hard to gain as their own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she replied, fondly, &ldquo;only you&rsquo;re a hard&mdash;hearted thing that&rsquo;s
      afraid to live in a cottage with me, I could tell you some good news&mdash;or
      rather you doubt me&mdash;and fear that I wouldn&rsquo;t live in one with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A kiss was the reply, after which he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With you, my dear Una, now that you&rsquo;re satisfied, I would live and die in
      a prison&mdash;with you, with you&mdash;in whatever state of life we may
      be placed, with you, but without you&mdash;never, I could not&mdash;I
      could not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we are young, you know, and neither of us proud&mdash;and I am not
      a lazy girl&mdash;indeed, I am not; but you forget the good news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forget that, and everything else but yourself, darling, while I&rsquo;m in
      your company. O heavens! if you were once my own, and that we were never
      to be separated!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but the good news!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haye mentioned our affection to my brother, and he has promised to
      assist us. He has heard of your character, and of your mother&rsquo;s, and says
      that it&rsquo;s unjust to visit upon you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused&mdash;&ldquo;You know, my dear Connor, that you must not be offended
      with anything I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, my sweet treasure, what you&rsquo;re going to say,&rdquo; replied Connor,
      with a smile; &ldquo;nobody need be delicate in saying that my father loves the
      money, and knows how to put guinea to guinea; that&rsquo;s no secret. I wish he
      loved it less, to be sure, but it cannot be helped; in the mean time, <i>ma
      colleen dhas dhun</i>&mdash;O, how I love them words! God bless your
      brother! he must have a kind heart, Una dear, and he must love you very
      much when he promises to assist us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has, and will; but, Connor, why did you send such a disagreeable,
      forward, and prying person, as your father&rsquo;s servant to bring me your
      message? I do not like him&mdash;he almost stared me out of countenance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow,&rdquo; said Connor, &ldquo;I feel a good dale for him, and I think he&rsquo;s
      an honest, good&mdash;hearted boy, and besides, he&rsquo;s in love himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know he, was always a starer, and I say again <i>I don&rsquo;t</i> like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, as the case stands, dear Una, I have no one else to trust to&mdash;at
      all events, he&rsquo;s in our secret, and the best way, if he&rsquo;s not honest, is
      to keep him in it; at laste, if we put him out of it now, he might be
      talking to our disadvantage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s truth in that, and we must only trust him with as little of our
      real secrets as possible; I cannot account for the strong prejudice I feel
      against him, and have felt for the past two years. He always dressed above
      his means, and once or twice attempted to speak to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but I know he&rsquo;s in love with some one, for he told me so; poor
      fellow, I&rsquo;m bound, my dear Una, to show him any kindness in my power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After some further conversation, it was once more decided that Fardorougha
      should, on the next day, see the Bodagh and his wife, in order to
      ascertain whether their consent could be obtained to the union of our
      young and anxious lovers. This step, as the reader knows, was every way in
      accordance with Fardorougha&rsquo;s inclination. Connor himself would have
      preferred his mother&rsquo;s advocacy to that of a person possessing such a
      slender hold on their good-will as his other parent. But upon consulting
      with her, she told him that the fact of the proposal coming from
      Fardorougha might imply a disposition on his part to provide for his son.
      At all events, she hoped that contradiction, the boast of superior wealth,
      or some fortunate collision of mind and principle, might strike a spark of
      generous feeling out of her husband&rsquo;s heart, which nothing, she knew,
      under strong excitement, such as might arise from the bitter pride of the
      O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s, could possibly do. Besides, as she had no favorable
      expectations from the interview, she thought it an unnecessary and painful
      task to subject herself to the insults which she apprehended from the
      Bodagh&rsquo;s wife, whose pride and importance towered far and high over those
      of her consequential husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      This just and sensible view of the matter, on the part of the mother,
      satisfied Connor, and reconciled him to the father&rsquo;s disinclination to be
      accompanied by her to the scene of conflict; for, in truth, Fardorougha
      protested against her assistance with a bitterness which could not easily
      be accounted for. &ldquo;If your mother goes, let her go by herself,&rdquo; said he;
      &ldquo;for I&rsquo;ll not interfere in&rsquo;t if she does. I&rsquo;ll take the dirty Bodagh and
      his fat wife my own way, which I can&rsquo;t do if Honor comes to be enibbin&rsquo; 
      and makin&rsquo; little o&rsquo; me afore them. Maybe I&rsquo;ll pull down their pride for
      them better than you think, and in a way they&rsquo;re not prepared for; them
      an&rsquo; their janting car!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither Connor nor his mother could help being highly amused at the
      singularity of the miserable pomp and parsimonious display resorted to by
      Fardorougha, in preparing for this extraordinary mission. Out of an old
      strongly locked chest he brought forth a gala coat, which had been duly
      aired, but not thrice worn within the last twenty years. The progress of
      time and fashion had left it so odd, outre, and ridiculous, that Connor,
      though he laughed, could not help feeling depressed on considering the
      appearance his father must make when dressed, or rather disfigured, in it.
      Next came a pair of knee&mdash;breeches by the same hand, and which, in
      compliance with the taste of the age that produced them, were made to
      button so far down as the calf of the leg. Then appeared a waistcoat,
      whose long pointed flaps reached nearly to the knees. Last of all was
      produced a hat not more than three inches deep in the crown, and brimmed
      so narrowly, that a spectator would almost imagine the leaf had been cut
      off. Having pranked himself out in these habiliments, contrary to the
      strongest expostulations of both wife and son, he took his staff and set
      forth. But lest the reader should expect a more accurate description of
      his person when dressed, we shall endeavor at all events to present him
      with a loose outline. In the first place, his head was surmounted with a
      hat that resembled a flat skillet, wanting the handle; his coat, from
      which avarice and penury had caused him to shrink away, would have fitted
      a man twice his size, and, as he had become much stooped, its tail, which,
      at the best, had been preposterously long, now nearly swept the ground. To
      look at him behind, in fact, he appeared all body. The flaps of his
      waistcoat he had pinned up with his own hands, by which piece of exquisite
      taste, he displayed a pair of thighs so thin and disproportioned to his
      small&mdash;clothes, that he resembled a boy who happens to wear the
      breeches of a full-grown man, so that to look at him in front he appeared
      all legs. A pair of shoes, polished with burned straw and buttermilk, and
      surmounted by two buckles, scoured away to skeletons, completed his
      costume. In this garb he set out with a crook-headed staff, into which
      long use, and the habit of griping fast whatever he got in his hand, had
      actually worn the marks of his forefinger and thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bodagh Buie, his wife, and their two children, were very luckily assembled
      in the parlor, when the nondescript figure of the deputy-wooer made his
      appearance on that part of the neat road which terminated at the gate of
      the little lawn that fronted the hall-door. Here there was another gate to
      the right that opened into the farm or kitchen yard, and as Fardorougha
      hesitated which to enter, the family within had an opportunity of getting
      a clearer view of his features and person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that quare figure standing there?&rdquo; inquired the Bodagh; &ldquo;did you
      ever see sich a&mdash;&mdash;ah, thin, who can he be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody comin&rsquo;, to see some of the sarvints, I suppose,&rdquo; replied his
      wife; &ldquo;why, thin, it&rsquo;s not unlike little Dick <i>Croaitha</i>, the
      fairyman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In sober truth, Fardorougha was so completely disguised by his dress,
      especially by his hat, whose shallowness and want of brim, gave his face
      and head so wild and eccentric an appearance, that we question if his own
      family, had they not seen him dress, could I have recognized him! At
      length he turned into the kitchen-yard, and, addressing a laborer whom he
      met, asked&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, nabor, which is the right way into Bodagh Buie&rsquo;s house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s two right ways into it, an&rsquo; you may take aither o&rsquo; them&mdash;but
      if you want any favor from him, you had better call him <i>Mr</i>.
      O&rsquo;Brien. The Bodagh&rsquo;s a name was first given to his father, an&rsquo; he bein&rsquo; a
      dacenter man, doesn&rsquo;t like it, although it sticks to him; so there&rsquo;s a
      lift for you, my hip striddled little codger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But which is the right door o&rsquo; the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There it is, the kitchen&mdash;peg in&mdash;that&rsquo;s your intrance, barrin&rsquo; 
      you&rsquo;re a gintleman in disguise, an&rsquo; if be, why turn out again to that
      other gate, strip off your shoes, and pass up ginteely on your tipytoes,
      and give a thunderin&rsquo; whack to the green ring that&rsquo;s hangin&rsquo; from the
      door. But see, friend,&rdquo; added the man, &ldquo;maybe you&rsquo;d do one a sarvice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How,&rdquo; said Fardorougha, looking earnestly at him; &ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, to lave us a lock o&rsquo; your hair before you go,&rdquo; replied the wag, with
      a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The miser took no notice whatsoever of this, but was turning quietly out
      of the yard, to enter by the lawn, when the man called out in a commanding
      voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back here, you codger!&mdash;tundher an&rsquo; thump!&mdash;back I say! You
      won&rsquo;t be let in that way&mdash;thramp back, you leprechaun, into the
      kitchen&mdash;eh! you won&rsquo;t&mdash;well, well, take what you&rsquo;ll get&mdash;an&rsquo; 
      that&rsquo;ll be the way back agin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Twas at this moment that the keen eye of Una recognized the features of
      her lover&rsquo;s father, and a smile, which she felt it impossible to subdue,
      settled upon her face, which became immediately mantled with blushes. On
      hurrying out of the room she plucked her brother&rsquo;s sleeve, who followed
      her to the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can scarcely tell you, dear John,&rdquo; she said, speaking rapidly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
      Fardorougha O&rsquo;Donovan, Connor&rsquo;s father; as you know his business, John,
      stay in the parlor;&rdquo; she squeezed his hand, and added with a smile on her
      face, and a tear in her eye, &ldquo;I fear it&rsquo;s all over with me&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
      know whether to laugh or cry&mdash;but stay, John dear, an&rsquo; fight my
      battle&mdash;Una&rsquo;s battle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ran upstairs, and immediately one of the most beggarly, sordid, and
      pusillanimous knocks that ever spoke of starvation and misery was heard at
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will answer it myself,&rdquo; thought the amiable brother; &ldquo;for if my father
      or mother does, he surely will not be allowed in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John could scarcely preserve a grave face, when Fardorougha presented
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Misther O&rsquo;Brien widin?&rdquo; inquired the usurer, shrewdly availing himself
      of the hint he received from the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father is,&rdquo; replied John; &ldquo;have the goodness to step in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fardorougha entered immediately, followed by young O&rsquo;Brien, who said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, this is Mr. O&rsquo;Donovan, who, it appears, has some important
      business with the family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be mistherin&rsquo; me,&rdquo; replied Fardorougha, helping himself to a seat;
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too poor to be misthered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With this family!&rdquo; exclaimed the father in amazement; &ldquo;what business can
      Fardorougha Donovan have with this family, John?&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About our children,&rdquo; replied the miser; &ldquo;about my son and your daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; what about them?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. O&rsquo;Brien; &ldquo;do you dar to mintion them
      in the same day together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not,&rdquo; said the miser; &ldquo;ay, an&rsquo; on the same night, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my reputaytion, Mr. O&rsquo;Donovan, you&rsquo;re extramely kind&mdash;now be a
      little more so, and let us undherstand you,&rdquo; said the Bodagh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Una!&rdquo; thought John, &ldquo;all&rsquo;s lost; he will get himself kicked out to a
      certainty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s time we got them married,&rdquo; replied Fardorougha; &ldquo;the sooner
      it&rsquo;s done the better, and the safer for both o&rsquo; them; especially for the
      colleen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Dar a Lorha</i>, he&rsquo;s cracked,&rdquo; said Mrs. O&rsquo;Brien; &ldquo;sorra one o&rsquo; the
      poor soul but&rsquo;s cracked about his money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor sowl, woman alive! wor you never poor yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yis I wor; an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m not ashamed to own it; but, Chierna, Frank,&rdquo; she
      added, addressing her husband, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no use in spakin&rsquo; to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fardorougha,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Brien, seriously, &ldquo;what brought you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, to tell you an&rsquo; your wife the state that my son, Connor, and your
      daughter&rsquo;s in about one another; an&rsquo; to advise you both, if you have
      sinse, to get them married afore worse happen. It&rsquo;s your business more nor
      mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said the Bodagh, aside to his wife; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s sartinly
      deranged. Fardorougha,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;have you lost any money lately?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m losin&rsquo; every day,&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m broke assistin&rsquo; them that
      won&rsquo;t thank me, let alone paying me as they ought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you have lost nothing more than usual?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t, I tell you there&rsquo;s a good chance of losin&rsquo; it before me;&mdash;can
      a man call any money of his safe that&rsquo;s in another man&rsquo;s pocket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; so you&rsquo;ve come to propose a marriage between your son and my
      daughter, yet you lost no money, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;re not mad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divil a morsel o&rsquo; me is mad&mdash;but you&rsquo;ll be so if you refuse to let
      this match go an.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out wid him&mdash;<i>a shan roghara</i>,&rdquo; shouted Mrs. O&rsquo;Brien, in a
      state of most dignified offence; &ldquo;<i>Damho orth</i>, you ould knave! is it
      the son of a miser that has fleeced an&rsquo; robbed the whole counthry side
      that we &lsquo;ud let our daughther, that resaved the finish to her edication in
      a Dubling boardin&rsquo; school, marry wid?&mdash;<i>Vic na hoiah</i> this day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had no sich scruple yourself, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied the bitter usurer,
      &ldquo;when you bounced at the son of the ould Bodagh Buie, an&rsquo; every one knows
      what he was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He!&rdquo; said the good woman; &ldquo;an&rsquo; is it runnin&rsquo; up comparishments betuxt
      yourself an&rsquo; him you are afther? Why, Saint Peter wouldn&rsquo;t thrive on your
      money, you nager.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe Saint Pethur thruv on worse&mdash;but havn&rsquo;t you thruv as well on
      the Bodagh&rsquo;s, as if it had been honestly come by? I defy you an&rsquo; the world
      both&mdash;to say that ever I tuck a penny from any one, more than my
      right. Lay that to the mimory of the ould Bodagh, an&rsquo; see if it&rsquo;ll fit.
      It&rsquo;s no light guinea, any how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Had Fardorougha been a man of ordinary standing and character in the
      country, from whom an insult could be taken, he would no doubt have been
      by a very summary process expelled the parlor. The history of his
      querulous and irascible temper, however, was so well known, and his
      offensive eccentricity of manner a matter of such established fact, that
      the father and son, on glancing at each other, were seized with the same
      spirit, and both gave way to an uncontrollable fit of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a laughin&rsquo; stock you&rsquo;re makin&rsquo; of&rsquo; it?&rdquo; said Mrs. O&rsquo;Brien, highly
      indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, achora, it may be no laughin&rsquo; stock afther all,&rdquo; replied the
      Bodagh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, mother,&rdquo; observed John, &ldquo;that you and my father had better treat
      the matter with more seriousness. Connor O&rsquo;Donovan is a young man not to
      be despised by any person at all near his own class of life who regards
      the peace and welfare of a daughter. His character stands very high;
      indeed, in every way unimpeachable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bitter scowl which had sat upon the small dark features of
      Fardorougha, when replying to the last attack of Mrs. O&rsquo;Brien, passed away
      as John spoke. The old man turned hastily around, and, surveying the
      eulogist of his son, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you, asthore, for thim words! and they&rsquo;re thrue&mdash;thrue as
      the gospel, arrah what are you both so proud of? I defy you to get the
      aquil of my son in the barony of Lisnamona, either for face, figure or
      temper! I say he&rsquo;s fit to be a husband for as good a gill as ever stood in
      your daughter&rsquo;s shoes; an&rsquo; from what I hear of her, she&rsquo;s as good a girl
      as ever the Almighty put breath in. God bless you, young man, you&rsquo;re a
      credit yourself to any parents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; we have nothin&rsquo; to say aginst your son, nor aginst your wife aither,&rdquo;
       replied the Bodagh; &ldquo;an&rsquo; if your own name was as clear&mdash;&mdash;if you
      wor looked upon as they are&mdash;tut, I&rsquo;m spakin&rsquo; nonsense! How do I know
      whether ever your son and my daughter spoke a word to one another or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go bail Oona never opened her lips to him,&rdquo; said her mother; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      go bail she had more spirit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll go bail she can&rsquo;t live widout him, an&rsquo; will have him whether you
      like it or not,&rdquo; said Fardorougha.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; observed John, &ldquo;will you and my father come into the next room
      for a minute&mdash;I wish to say a word or two to each of you; and will
      you, Fardorougha, have the goodness to sit here till we return?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divil a notion,&rdquo; replied O&rsquo;Donovan, &ldquo;I have of stirrin&rsquo; my foot till the
      thing&rsquo;s settled one way or other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said young O&rsquo;Brien, when they got into the back parlor, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s right
      that you both should know to what length the courtship between Una and
      Connor O&rsquo;Donovan has gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coortship! <i>Vich no hoiah!</i> sure she wouldn&rsquo;t go to coort wid the
      son o&rsquo; that ould schamer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to fear that it&rsquo;s too thrue,&rdquo; observed the Bodagh; &ldquo;and if
      she has&mdash;but let us hear John.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly true, indeed, mother, that she has,&rdquo; said the son. &ldquo;Yes,
      and they are both this moment pledged, betrothed, promised, solemnly
      promised to each other; and in my opinion the old man within is acting a
      more honorable part than either of you give him credit for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, well,&rdquo; exclaimed the mother; &ldquo;who afther that would ever
      thrust a daughter? The girl that we rared up as tindher as a chicking, to
      go to throw herself away upon the son of ould Fardorougha Donovan, the
      misert! Confusion to the ring ever he&rsquo;ll put an her! I&rsquo;d see her stretched
      (dead) first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree with you in that, Bridget,&rdquo; said the husband; &ldquo;if it was only to
      punish her thrachery and desate, I&rsquo;ll take good care a ring will never go
      on them; but how do you know all this, John?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Una&rsquo;s own lips, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bodagh paced to and fro in much agitation; one hand in his small&mdash;clothes
      pocket, and the other twirling his watch-key as rapidly as he could. The
      mother, in the meantime, had thrown herself into a chair, and gave way to
      a violent fit of grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have this from Una&rsquo;s own lips?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, father, I have; and it is much to her credit that she was candid
      enough to place such confidence in her brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pledged and promised to one another. Bridget, who could believe this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe it! I don&rsquo;t believe it&mdash;it&rsquo;s only a schame of the hussy to
      get him. Oh, thin, Queen of Heaven this day, but it&rsquo;s black news to us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John,&rdquo; said the father, &ldquo;tell Una to come down to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, I doubt that&rsquo;s rather a trying task for her. I wish, you wouldn&rsquo;t
      insist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go off, sir; she must come down immediately, I&rsquo;ll have it from her own
      lips, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without another word of remonstrance the son went to bring her down. When
      the brother and sister entered the room, O&rsquo;Brien still paced the floor. He
      stood, and, turning his eyes upon his daughter with severe displeasure,
      was about to speak, but he appeared to have lost the power of utterance;
      and, after one or two ineffectual attempts, the big tears fairly rolled
      down his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, see,&rdquo; said the mother, &ldquo;see what you have brought us to. Is it thrue
      that you&rsquo;re promised to Fardorougha&rsquo;s son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Una tottered over to a chair, and the blood left her cheeks; her lips
      became dry, and she gasped for breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you think it worth your while to answer me?&rdquo; continued the
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The daughter gave a look of deep distress and supplication at her brother;
      but when she perceived her father in tears, her head sank down upon her
      bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! what! Una,&rdquo; exclaimed the Bodagh, &ldquo;Una&mdash;&rdquo; But ere he could
      complete the question, the timid creature fell senseless upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time she lay in that friendly trance, for such, in truth, it
      was to a delicate being, subjected to an ordeal so painful as that she was
      called upon to pass through. We have, indeed, remarked that there is in
      the young, especially in those of the softer sex, a feeling of terror, and
      shame, and confusion, when called upon by their parents to disclose a
      forbidden passion, that renders its avowal perhaps the most formidable
      task which the young heart can undergo. It is a fearful trial for the
      youthful, and one which parents ought to conduct with surpassing delicacy
      and tenderness, unless they wish to drive the ingenuous spirit into the
      first steps of falsehood and deceit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;I think you may rest satisfied with what you
      witness; and I am sure it cannot make you or mother happy to see poor Una
      miserable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Una, who had been during the greater part of her swoon supported in her
      weeping and alarmed mother&rsquo;s arms, now opened her eyes, and, after casting
      an affrighted look about the room, she hid her face in her mother&rsquo;s bosom,
      and exclaimed, as distinctly as the violence of sobbing grief would permit
      her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mother dear, have pity on me! bring me up stairs and I will tell
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, I do pity you,&rdquo; said the mother, kissing her; &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;ll be a
      good girl yet, Oona.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Una,&rdquo; said her father, placing his hand gently on her shoulder, &ldquo;was I
      ever harsh to you, or did I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father dear,&rdquo; she returned, interrupting him, &ldquo;I would have told you and
      my mother, but that I was afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something so utterly innocent and artless in this reply, that
      each of the three persons present felt sensibly affected by its extreme
      and childlike simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid of me, Una,&rdquo; continued the Bodagh, &ldquo;but answer&mdash;me
      truly, like a good girl, and I swear upon my reputation, that I won&rsquo;t be
      angry. Do you love the son of this Fardorougha?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not, father, because he&rsquo;s Fardorougha&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; said Una, whose face was
      still hid in her mother&rsquo;s bosom; &ldquo;I would rather he wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you do love him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For three years he has scarcely been out of my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something that might be termed a smile crossed the countenance of the
      Bodagh at this intimation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God help you for a foolish child!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a poor counsellor
      when left to defend your own cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t defend it by a falsehood, at all events,&rdquo; observed her
      trustworthy and affectionate brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the mother; &ldquo;and I did her wrong a while ago, to
      say that she&rsquo;d schame anything about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are you and Connor O&rsquo;Donovan promised to aich other?&rdquo; inquired the
      father again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t I that proposed the promise,&rdquo; returned Una.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the desperate villain,&rdquo; exclaimed her father, &ldquo;to be guilty of such a
      thing! but you took the promise Una&mdash;you did&mdash;you did&mdash;I
      needn&rsquo;t ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Una.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; reechoed the father; &ldquo;then you did not give the promise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; she rejoined, &ldquo;that you needn&rsquo;t ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, faith, that alters the case extremely. Now, Una, this&mdash;all this
      promising that has passed between you and Connor O&rsquo;Donovan is all folly.
      If you prove to be the good obedient girl that I hope you are, you&rsquo;ll put
      him out of your head, and then you can give back to one another whatever
      promises you made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was succeeded by a silence of more than a minute. Una at length
      arose, and, with a composed energy of manner, that was evident by her
      sparkling eye and bloodless cheek, she approached her father, and calmly
      kneeling down, said slowly but firmly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, if nothing else can satisfy you, I will give back my promise; but
      then, father, it will break my heart, for I know&mdash;I feel&mdash;how I
      love him, and how I am loved by him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you a better husband,&rdquo; replied her father&mdash;&ldquo;far more
      wealthy and more respectable than he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give back the promise,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;but the man is not living, except
      Connor O&rsquo;Donovan, that will ever call me wife. More wealthy! more
      respectable!&mdash;Oh, it was only himself I loved. Father, I&rsquo;m on my
      knees before you, and before my mother. I have only one request to make&mdash;Oh,
      don&rsquo;t break your daughter&rsquo;s heart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God direct us,&rdquo; exclaimed her mother; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s hard to know how to act. If
      it would go so hard upon her, sure&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; said her husband; &ldquo;may God direct us to the best! I&rsquo;m sure God
      knows,&rdquo; he continued, now much affected, &ldquo;that I would rather break my own
      heart than yours, Una. Get up, dear&mdash;rise. John, how would you advise
      us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any serious objection, after all,&rdquo; replied the son, &ldquo;either
      you or my mother can have to Connor O&rsquo;Donovan. He is every way worthy of
      her, if he is equal to his character; and as for wealth, I have often
      heard it said that his father was a richer man than yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afther all,&rdquo; said the mother, &ldquo;she might be very well wid him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do, then,&rdquo; said the Bodagh&mdash;&ldquo;let us see the
      ould man himself, and if he settles his son dacently in life, as he can do
      if he wishes, why, I won&rsquo;t see the poor, foolish, innocent girl breaking
      her heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Una, who had sat with her face still averted, now ran to her father, and,
      throwing her arms about his neck, wept aloud, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s very fine now that you have everything
      your own way, you girsha; but, sure, you&rsquo;re all the daughter we have,
      achora, and it would be too bad not to let you have a little of your own
      opinion in the choice of a husband. Now go up stairs, or where you please,
      till we see what can be done with Fardorougha himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With smiling face and glistening eyes Una passed out of the room, scarcely
      sensible whether she walked, ran, or flew, while the others went to renew
      the discussion with Pardorougha.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the miser, &ldquo;you found out, I suppose, that she can&rsquo;t do
      widout him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Provided we consent to the marriage,&rdquo; asked the Bodagh, &ldquo;how will you
      settle your son in life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who would I settle in life if I wouldn&rsquo;t settle my only son?&rdquo; replied the
      other; &ldquo;who else is there to get all I have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very true,&rdquo; observed the Bodagh; &ldquo;but state plainly what you&rsquo;ll do
      for him on his marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you consint to the marriage all of yees?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the question,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Divil a word I&rsquo;ll answer till
      I know whither yees do or not,&rdquo; said Fardorougha. &ldquo;Say at once that you
      consint, and then I&rsquo;ll spake&mdash;I&rsquo;ll say what I&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bodagh looked inquiringly at his wife and son. The latter nodded
      affirmatively. &ldquo;We do consent,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That shows your own sinse,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;Now what fortune will you
      portion your colleen wid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depinds upon what you&rsquo;ll do for your son,&rdquo; returned the Bodagh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that depinds upon what you&rsquo;ll do for your daughter,&rdquo; replied the
      sagacious old miser.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At this rate we&rsquo;re not likely to agree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;s asier; you have only to spake out; besides it&rsquo;s your business,
      bein&rsquo; the colleen&rsquo;s father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try him, and name something fair,&rdquo; whispered John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I give her a farm of thirty acres of good land, stocked and all, what
      will you do for Connor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More than that, five times over; I&rsquo;ll give him all I have. An&rsquo; now when
      will we marry them? Throth it was best to make things clear,&rdquo; added the
      knave, &ldquo;and undherstand one another at wanst. When will we marry them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not till you say out openly and fairly the exact amount of money you&rsquo;ll
      lay down on the nail&mdash;an&rsquo; that before even a ring goes upon them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it up, acushla,&rdquo; said the wife, &ldquo;you see there&rsquo;s no screwin&rsquo; a
      promise out of him, let alone a penny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What &lsquo;ud yees have me do?&rdquo; said the old man, raising his voice. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t he
      have all I&rsquo;m worth? Who else is to have it? Am I to make a beggar of
      myself to please you? Can&rsquo;t they live on your farm till I die, an&rsquo; thin
      it&rsquo;ll all come to them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; no thanks to you for that, Fardorougha,&rdquo; said the Bodagh. &ldquo;No, no;
      I&rsquo;ll never buy a pig in a poke. If you won&rsquo;t act generously by your son,
      go home, in the name of goodness, and let us hear no more about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, why?&rdquo; asked the miser, &ldquo;are yees mad to miss what I can leave him?
      If you knew how much it is, you&rsquo;d snap&mdash;; but God help me! what am I
      sayin&rsquo;? I&rsquo;m poorer than anybody thinks. I am&mdash;I am; an&rsquo; will starve
      among you all, if God hasn&rsquo;t sed it. Do you think I don&rsquo;t love my son as
      well, an&rsquo; a thousand times better, than you do your daughter? God alone
      sees how my heart&rsquo;s in him&mdash;in my own Connor, that never gave me a
      sore heart&mdash;my brave, my beautiful boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and the scalding tears here ran down his shrunk and furrowed
      cheeks, whilst he wrung his hands, started to his feet, and looked about
      him like a man encompassed by dangers that threatened instant destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you love your son so well,&rdquo; said John, mildly, &ldquo;why do you grudge to
      share your wealth with him? It is but natural and it is your duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Natural! what&rsquo;s natural?&mdash;to give away&mdash;is it to love him you
      mane? It is, it&rsquo;s unnatural to give it away. He&rsquo;s the best son&mdash;the
      best&mdash;what do you mane, I say?&mdash;let me alone&mdash;let me alone&mdash;I
      could give him my blood, my blood&mdash;to sich a boy; but, you want to
      kill me&mdash;you want to kill me, an&rsquo; thin you&rsquo;ll get all; but he&rsquo;ll
      cross you, never fear&mdash;my boy will save me&mdash;he&rsquo;s not tired of me&mdash;he&rsquo;d
      give up fifty girls sooner than see a hair of his father&rsquo;s head injured&mdash;so
      do your best, while I have Connor, I&rsquo;m not afraid of yees. Thanks be to
      God that sent him!&rdquo; he exclaimed, dropping suddenly on his knees&mdash;&ldquo;oh,
      thanks be to God that sent him to comfort an&rsquo; protect his father from the
      schames and villainy of them that &lsquo;ud bring him to starvation for their
      own ends!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said John, in a low tone, &ldquo;this struggle between avarice and
      natural affection is awful. See how his small gray eyes glare, and the
      froth rises white to his thin shrivelled lips. What is to be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fardorougha,&rdquo; said the Bodagh, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s over; don&rsquo;t distress yourself&mdash;keep
      your money&mdash;there will be no match between our childhre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? why won&rsquo;t there?&rdquo; he screamed&mdash;&ldquo;why won&rsquo;t there, I say? Havn&rsquo;t
      you enough for them until I die? Would you see your child breakin&rsquo; her
      heart? Bodagh, you have no nather in you&mdash;no bowels for your <i>colleen
      dahs</i>. But I&rsquo;ll spake for her&mdash;I&rsquo;ll argue wid you till this time
      to-morrow, or I&rsquo;ll make you show feelin&rsquo; to her&mdash;an&rsquo; if you don&rsquo;t&mdash;if
      you don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wid the help o&rsquo; God, the man&rsquo;s as mad as a March hare,&rdquo; observed Mrs.
      O&rsquo;Brien, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s no use in losin&rsquo; breath wid him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s not insanity,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;I know not what it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; proceeded Fardorougha, who evidently paid no attention to
      what the mother and son said, being merely struck by the voice of the
      latter, &ldquo;young man, you&rsquo;re kind, you have sinse and feelin&rsquo;&mdash;spake to
      your father&mdash;don&rsquo;t let him destroy his child&mdash;don&rsquo;t ax him to
      starve me, that never did him harm. He loves you&mdash;he loves you, for
      he can&rsquo;t but love you&mdash;sure, I know how I love my own darlin&rsquo; boy.
      Oh, spake to him&mdash;here I go down on my knees to you, to beg, as you
      hope to see God in heaven, that&rsquo;t you&rsquo;ll make him not break his daughter&rsquo;s
      heart! She&rsquo;s your own sister&mdash;there&rsquo;s but the two of yees, an&rsquo; oh,
      don&rsquo;t desart her in this throuble&mdash;this heavy, heavy throuble!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t interfere farther in it,&rdquo; replied the young man, who, however,
      felt disturbed and anxious in the extreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. O&rsquo;Brien,&rdquo; said he, turning imploringly, and with a wild, haggard
      look to the Bodngh&rsquo;s wifs, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m turnin&rsquo; to you&mdash;you&rsquo;re her mother&mdash;Oh
      think, think&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think no more about it,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re mad, an&rsquo; thank God, we
      know it. Of coorse it&rsquo;ll run in the family, for which reasing my daughter
      &lsquo;ill never be joined to the son of a madman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then turned as a last resource to O&rsquo;Brien himself. &ldquo;Bodagh, Bodagh, I
      say,&rdquo; here his voice rose to a frightful pitch, &ldquo;I enthrate, I order, I
      command you to listen to me! Marry them&mdash;don&rsquo;t kill your daughter,
      an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t, dare to kill my son. If you do I&rsquo;ll curse you till the
      marks of your feet will scorch the ground you tread on. Oh,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
      his voice now sinking, and his reason awaking apparently from exhaustion,
      &ldquo;what is come over me? what am I sayin&rsquo;?&mdash;but it&rsquo;s all for my son, my
      son.&rdquo; He then rose, sat down, and for more than tweny minutes wept like an
      infant, and sobbed and sighed as if his heart would break.
    </p>
    <p>
      A feeling very difficult to be described hushed his amazed auditory into
      silence; they felt something like pity towards the unfortunate old man, as
      well as respect for that affection which struggled with such moral heroism
      against the frightful vice that attempted to subdue this last surviving
      virtue in the breast of the miser.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his getting calm, they spoke to him kindly, but in firm and friendly
      terms communicated their ultimate determination, that, in consequence of
      his declining to make an adequate provision for the son, the marriage
      could by no means take place. He then got his hat, and attempted to reach
      the road which led down to the little lawn, but so complete was his
      abstraction, and so exhausted his faculties, that it was not without
      John&rsquo;s assistance he could reach the gate which lay before his eyes. He
      first turned out of the walk to the right, then crossed over to the left,
      and felt surprised that a wall opposed him in each direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too much disturbed,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;to perceive the way, but I will
      show you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I thought it was at home I was,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;bekase at my own
      house one must turn aither to the right or to the left, as, indeed, I&rsquo;m in
      the custom of doin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whilst Fardorougha was engaged upon his ill-managed mission, his wife, who
      felt that all human efforts at turning the heart of her husband from his
      wealth must fail, resolved to have recourse to a higher power. With this
      purpose in view, she put on her Sunday dress, and informed Connor that she
      was about to go for a short time from home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back if I can,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;before your father; and, indeed, it&rsquo;s
      as good not to let him know anything about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About what, mother? for I know as little about it as he does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, my dear boy, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to get a couple o&rsquo; masses sed, for God to
      turn his heart from that cursed <i>airaghid</i> it&rsquo;s fixed upon. Sure it
      houlds sich a hard grip of his poor sowl, that it&rsquo;ll be the destruction of
      him here an&rsquo; hereafther. It&rsquo;ll kill him afore his time, an&rsquo; then I
      thrimble to think of his chance above.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The object is a good one, sure enough, an&rsquo; it bein&rsquo; for a spiritual
      purpose the priest won&rsquo;t object to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why would he, dear, an&rsquo; it for the good of his sowl? Sure, when Pat
      Lanigan was jealous, his wife got three masses sed for him; and, wid the
      help o&rsquo; God, he was cured sound and clane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connor could not help smiling at this extraordinary cure for jealousy, nor
      at the simple piety of a heart, the strength of whose affection he knew so
      well. After her return she informed the son, that, in addition to the
      masses to be said against his father&rsquo;s avarice, she had some notion of
      getting another said towards his marriage with Una.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God help you, mother,&rdquo; said Connor, laughing; &ldquo;for I think you&rsquo;re one of
      the innocentest women that ever lived; but whisht!&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s my
      father&mdash;God grant that he may bring good news!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Fardorougha entered he was paler or rather sallower than usual; and,
      on his thin, puckered face, the lines that marked it were exhibited with a
      distinctness greater than ordinary. His eyes appeared to have sunk back
      more deeply into his head; his cheeks had fallen farther into his jaws;
      his eyes were gleamy and disturbed; and his Whole appearance bespoke
      trouble and care and the traces of a strong and recent struggle within
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Connor, with a beating heart, &ldquo;for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, what news&mdash;what
      tidings? I trust in God it&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have no bowels, Connor&mdash;they have no bowels, thim O&rsquo;Briens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you didn&rsquo;t succeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The father&rsquo;s as great a bodagh as him he was called after&mdash;they&rsquo;re a
      bad pack&mdash;an&rsquo; you mustn&rsquo;t think of any one belongin&rsquo;to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But tell us, man dear,&rdquo; said the wife, &ldquo;what passed&mdash;let us know it
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, they would do nothin&rsquo;&mdash;they wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it. I went on my
      knees to them&mdash;ay, to every one of them, barrin&rsquo; the colleen herself;
      but it was all no use&mdash;it&rsquo;s to be no match.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why, father, did you go on your knees to any of them,&rdquo; said Connor;
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you did that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did it on your account, Connor, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d do it again on your account,
      poor boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, it can&rsquo;t be helped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But tell me, Fardorougha,&rdquo; inquired Honor, &ldquo;was any of the fault your own&mdash;what
      did you offer to do for Connor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me alone,&rdquo; said he, peevishly; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be cross-questioned about it.
      My heart&rsquo;s broke among you all&mdash;what did I offer to do for Connor?
      The match is knocked up, I tell you&mdash;and it must be knocked up.
      Connor&rsquo;s young, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;ll be time enough for him to marry this seven years
      to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he said this, the fire of avarice blazed in his eyes, and he looked
      angrily at Honor, then at the son; but, while contemplating the latter,
      his countenance changed from anger to sorrow, and from sorrow to a mild
      and serene expression of affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor, avick,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Connor, sure you&rsquo;ll not blame me in this
      business? sure you won&rsquo;t blame your poor, heart&mdash;broken father, let
      thim say what they will, sure you won&rsquo;t, avilish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fret on my account, father,&rdquo; said the sonj &ldquo;why should I blame you?
      God knows you&rsquo;re strivin&rsquo; to do what you would wish for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Honor, I know he wouldn&rsquo;t; no,&rdquo; he shouted, leaping up, &ldquo;he wouldn&rsquo;t
      make a saicrefize o&rsquo; me! Connor, save me, save me,&rdquo; he shrieked, throwing
      his arms about his neck; &ldquo;save me; my heart&rsquo;s breakin&rsquo;&mdash;somethin&rsquo;s
      tearin&rsquo; me different ways inside; I can cry, you see; I can cry, but I&rsquo;m
      still as hard as a stone; it&rsquo;s terrible this I&rsquo;m sufferin&rsquo;&mdash;terrible
      all out for a weak ould man like me. Oh, Connor, avick, what will I do?
      Honor, achora, what &lsquo;ill become o&rsquo; me&mdash;ainn&rsquo;t I strugglin&rsquo;,
      strugglin&rsquo; against it, whatever it is; don&rsquo;t yees pity me? Don&rsquo;t ye, avick
      machree, don&rsquo;t ye, Honor? Oh, don&rsquo;t yees pity me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God pity you!&rdquo; said the wife, bursting into tears; &ldquo;what will become of
      you? Pray to God, Fardorougha, pray to Him. No one alive can change your
      heart but God. I wint to the priest to-day, to get two masses said to turn
      your heart from that cursed money. I didn&rsquo;t intind to tell you, but I do,
      bekase it&rsquo;s your duty to pray now above all times, an&rsquo; to back the priest
      as well as you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best advice, father, you could get,&rdquo; said the son, as he helped
      the trembling old man to his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; who bid you thin to go to lavish money that way?&rdquo; said he, turning
      snappishly to Honor, and relapsing again into the peevish spirit of
      avarice; &ldquo;Saver o&rsquo; Heaven, but you&rsquo;ll kill me, woman, afore you have done
      wid me! How can I stand it, to have my hard&mdash;earned&mdash;&mdash;an&rsquo; 
      for what? to turn my heart from money? I don&rsquo;t want to be turned from it&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t wish it! Money!&mdash;I have no money&mdash;nothin&rsquo;&mdash;nothin&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; 
      if there&rsquo;s not better decreed for me, I&rsquo;ll be starved yet&mdash;an&rsquo; is it
      any wondh&rsquo;er? to be robbin&rsquo; me the way you&rsquo;re doin&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife clasped her hands and looked up towards heaven in silence, and
      Connor, shaking his head despairingly, passed out to join Flanagan at his
      labor, with whom he had not spoken that day. Briefly, and with a heavy
      heart, he communicated to him the unsuccessful issue of his father&rsquo;s
      interference, and asked his opinion as to how he should conduct himself
      under circumstances so disastrous to his happiness and prospects. Bartle
      advised him to seek another interview with Una, and, for that purpose,
      offered, as before, to ascertain, in the course of that evening, at what
      time and place she would see him. This suggestion, in itself so natural,
      was adopted, and as Connor felt, with a peculiar acuteness, the pain of
      the situation in which he was! placed, he manifested little tendency to
      conversation, and the evening consequently passed heavily and in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dusk, however, arrived, and Bartle prepared himself to execute the
      somewhat difficult commission he had so obligingly undertaken. He
      appeared, however, to have caught a portion of Connor&rsquo;s despondency, for,
      when about to set out, he said &ldquo;that he felt his spirits sunk and
      melancholy; just,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;as if some misfortune, Connor, was afore
      aither or both of us; for my part I&rsquo;d stake my life that things will go
      ashanghran one way or other, an&rsquo; that you&rsquo;ll never call Una O&rsquo;Brien your
      wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bartle,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;I only want you to do my message, an&rsquo; not be
      prophesyin&rsquo; ill&mdash;bad news comes to soon, without your tellin&rsquo; us of
      it aforehand. God knows, Bartle dear, I&rsquo;m distressed enough as it is, and
      want my spirits to be kept up rather than put down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Connor, but you want somethin&rsquo; to divart your mind off this business
      altogether, for a while; an&rsquo; upon my saunies it &lsquo;ud be a charity for some
      friend to give you a fresh piece of fun to think of&mdash;so keep up your
      heart, how do you know but I may do that much for you myself? But I want
      you to lend me the loan of a pair of shoes; divil a tatther of these will
      be together soon, barrin&rsquo; I get them mended in time; you can&rsquo;t begrudge
      that, any how, an&rsquo; me wearin&rsquo; them on your own business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, man&mdash;to be sure I will; stop an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll bring them out to
      you in half a shake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He accordingly produced a pair of shoes, nearly new, and told Bartle that
      if he had no objection to accept of them as a present, he might consider
      them as his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      This conversation took place in Fardorougha&rsquo;s barn, where Flanagan always
      slept, and kept his small deal trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused a moment when this good&mdash;natured offer was made to him; but
      as it was dark no particular expression could be discovered on his
      countenance,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; said he vehemently; &ldquo;may I go to perdition if I ought!&mdash;Connor&mdash;Connor
      O&rsquo; Donovan&mdash;you&rsquo;d turn the div&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halt, Bartle, don&rsquo;t be angry&mdash;whin I offered them, I didn&rsquo;t mane to
      give you the slightest offence; it&rsquo;s enough for you to tell me you won&rsquo;t
      have them without gettin&rsquo; into a passion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have what? what are you spakin&rsquo; about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;about the shoes; what else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, faith, sure enough&mdash;well, ay, the shoes!&mdash;don&rsquo;t think of
      it, Connor&mdash;I&rsquo;m hasty; too much so, indeed, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s my fault. I&rsquo;m
      like all good-natured people in that respect; however, I&rsquo;ll borry them for
      a day or two, till I get my own patched up some way. But, death alive, why
      did you get at this season o&rsquo; the year three rows of sparables in the
      soles o&rsquo; them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bekase they last longer, of coorse; and now, Bartle, be off, and don&rsquo;t
      let the grass grow under your feet till I see you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connor&rsquo;s patience, or rather his impatience, that night, was severely
      taxed. Hour after hour elapsed, and yet Bartle did not return. At length
      he went to his father&rsquo;s sleeping-room, and informed him of the message he
      had sent through Flanagan to Una.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will sleep in the barn to-night, father,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;an&rsquo; never fear,
      let us talk as we may, but we&rsquo;ll be up early enough in the morning, plase
      God. I couldn&rsquo;t sleep, or go to sleep, till I hear what news he brings
      back to us; so do you rise and secure the door, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll make my shakedown
      wid Bartle this night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The father who never refused him anything unpecuniary (if we may be
      allowed the word), did as the son requested him, and again went to bed,
      unconscious of the thundercloud which was so soon to burst upon them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bartle, however, at length returned, and Connor had the satisfaction of
      hearing that his faithful Una would meet him the next night, if possible,
      at the hour of twelve o&rsquo;clock, in her father&rsquo;s haggard. Her parents, it
      appeared, had laid an injunction upon her never to see him again; she was
      watched, too, and, unless when the household were asleep, she found it
      altogether impracticable to effect any appointment whatsoever with her
      lover. She could not even promise with certainty to meet him on that
      night, but she desired him to come, and if she failed to be punctual, not
      to leave the place of appointment for an hour. After that, if she appeared
      not, then he was to wait no longer. Such was the purport of the message
      which Flanagan delivered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flanagan was the first up the next morning, for the purpose of keeping an
      appointment which he had with Biddy Neil, whom we have already introduced
      to the reader. On being taxed with meanness by this weak but honest
      creature, for having sought service with the man who had ruined his
      family, he promised to acquaint her with the true motive which had induced
      him to enter into Fardorougha&rsquo;s employment. Their conversation on this
      point, however, was merely a love scene, in which Bartle satisfied the
      credulous girl, that to an attachment for herself of some months&rsquo; 
      standing, might be ascribed his humiliation in becoming a servant to the
      oppressor and destroyer of his house. He then passed from themselves and
      their prospects to Connor and Una O&rsquo;Brien, with whose attachment for each
      other, as the reader knows, he was first made acquainted by his
      fellow-servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s terrible, Biddy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to think of the black and revengeful
      heart that Connor bears to Bodagh Buie and his family merely bekase they
      rufuse to let him marry Una. I&rsquo;m afeard, Biddy darlin&rsquo;, that there&rsquo;ll be
      dark work about it on Connor&rsquo;s side; an&rsquo; if you hear of anything bad
      happenin&rsquo; to the Bodagh, you&rsquo;ll know where it comes from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;lieve it, Bartle, nor I won&rsquo;t b&rsquo;lieve it&mdash;not, any way,
      till I hear that it happens. But what is it he intends to do to them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s more than I know myself,&rdquo; replied Bartle; &ldquo;I axed as much, an&rsquo; he
      said till it was done nobody would be the wiser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s quare,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;for a better heart than Connor has, the
      Saver o&rsquo; the world never made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so, agra, but wait; do you watch, and you&rsquo;ll find that he don&rsquo;t
      come in to-night. I know nothin&rsquo; myself of what he&rsquo;s about, for he&rsquo;s as
      close as his father&rsquo;s purse, an&rsquo; as deep as a draw&mdash;well; but this I
      know, that he has black business on his hands, whatever it is. I trimble
      to think of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flanagan then got tender, and, after pressing his suit with all the
      eloquence he was master of, they separated, he to his labor in the fields,
      and she to her domestic employment, and the unusual task of watching the
      motions of her master&rsquo;s son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flanagan, in the course of the day, suggested to Connor the convenience of
      sleeping that night also in the barn. The time of meeting, he said was too
      late, and his father&rsquo;s family, who were early in their hours, both night
      and morning, would be asleep even before they set out. He also added, that
      lest any of the O&rsquo;Briens or their retainers should surprise him and Una,
      he had made up his mind to accompany him, and act as a vidette during
      their interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connor felt this devotion of Bartle to his dearest interests, as every
      grateful and generous heart would.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bartle,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;when we are married, if it&rsquo;s ever in my power to make
      you aisy in life, may I never prosper if I don&rsquo;t do it! At all events, in
      some way I&rsquo;ll reward you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re ever able, Connor, I&rsquo;ll have no objection to be behoulden to
      you; that is, if you&rsquo;re ever able, as you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if there&rsquo;s a just God in heaven, Bartle, who sees my heart, however
      things may go against me for a time, I say I will be able to sarve you, or
      any other friend that desarves it. But about sleepin&rsquo; in to-night&mdash;coorse
      I wouldn&rsquo;t be knockin&rsquo; up my father, and disturbin&rsquo; my poor mother for no
      rason; so, of coorse, as I said, I&rsquo;ll sleep in the barn; it makes no
      difference one way or other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor,&rdquo; said Flanagan, with much solemnity, &ldquo;if Bodagh Buie&rsquo;s wise,
      he&rsquo;ll marry you and his daughter as fast as he can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; why, Bartle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, for rasons you know nothin&rsquo; about. Of late he&rsquo;s got very much out o&rsquo; 
      favor, in regard of not comin&rsquo; in to what people wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak plainer, Bartle; I&rsquo;m in the dark now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s work goin&rsquo; on in the counthry, that you and every one like you
      ought to be up to; but you know nothin&rsquo;, as I said, about it. Now Bodagh
      Buie, as far as I hear&mdash;for I&rsquo;m in the dark myself nearly as much as
      you&mdash;Bodagh Buie houlds out against them; an&rsquo; not only that, I&rsquo;m
      tould, but gives them hard words, an&rsquo; sets them at defiance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what has all this to do with me marrying his daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he wants some one badly to stand his friend wid them; an&rsquo; if you
      were married to her, you should on his account become one o&rsquo; thim; begad,
      as it is, you ought, for to tell the truth there&rsquo;s talk&mdash;strong talk
      too&mdash;about payin&rsquo; him a nightly visit that mayn&rsquo;t sarve him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, Bartle, you&rsquo;re consarned in this business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, faith, not yet; but I suppose I must, if I wish to be safe in the
      counthry; an&rsquo; so must you too, for the same rason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, if not up, how do you know so much about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From one o&rsquo; themselves, that wishes the! Bodagh well; ay, an&rsquo; let me tell
      you, he&rsquo;s a marked man, an&rsquo; the night was appointed to visit him; still it
      was put back to thry if he could be managed, but he couldn&rsquo;t; an&rsquo; all I
      know about it is that the time to remimber him is settled, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s to get
      it, an&rsquo;, along wid other things, he&rsquo;ll be ped for turnin&rsquo; off&mdash;however,
      I can&rsquo;t say any more about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long is it since you knew this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not long&mdash;only since last night, or you&rsquo;d a got it before this. The
      best way, I think, to put him on his guard &lsquo;ud be to send him a scrape of
      a line wid no name to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bartle,&rdquo; replied Connor, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as much behoulden to you for this, as if it
      had been myself or my father that was marked. God knows you have a good
      heart, an&rsquo; if you don&rsquo;t sleep sound, I&rsquo;m at a loss to know who ought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s hard to tell who has a good heart, Connor; I&rsquo;d never say any one
      has till I&rsquo;d seen them well thried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At length the hour for setting out arrived, and both, armed with good
      oaken cudgels proceeded to Bodagh Buie&rsquo;s haggard, whither they arrived a
      little before the appointed hour. An utter stillness prevailed around the
      place&mdash;not a dog barked&mdash;not a breeze blew, nor did a leaf move
      on its stem, so calm and warm was the night. Neither moon nor stars shone
      in the firmament, and the darkness seemed kindly to throw its dusky mantle
      over this sweet and stolen interview of our young lovers. As yet, however,
      Una had not come, nor could Connor, on surveying the large massy farm&mdash;house
      of the Bodagh, perceive any appearance of light, or hear a single sound,
      however faint, to break the stillness in which it slept. Bartle,
      immediately after their arrival in the haggard, separated from his
      companion, in order, he said, to give notice of interruption, should Una
      be either watched or followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, you know,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;sweethearts like nobody to be present but
      themselves, when they do be spakin&rsquo; soft to one another. So I&rsquo;ll just keep
      dodgin&rsquo; about, from place to place wid my eye an&rsquo; ear both open, an&rsquo; if
      any intherloper comes I&rsquo;ll give yees the hard word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Heavily and lazily creep those moments during which an impatient lover
      awaits the approach of his mistress; and woe betide the wooer of impetuous
      temperament who is doomed, like our hero, to watch a whole hour and a half
      in vain. Many a theory did his fancy body forth, and many a conjecture did
      he form, as to the probable cause of her absence. Was it possible that
      they watched her even in the dead hour of night? Perhaps the grief she
      felt at her father&rsquo;s refusal to sanction the match had brought on
      indisposition; and&mdash;oh, harrowing thought!&mdash;perhaps they had
      succeeded in prevailing upon her to renounce him and his hopes forever.
      But no; their affection was too pure and steadfast to admit of a
      supposition so utterly unreasonable. What, then, could have prevented her
      from keeping an appointment so essential to their future prospects, and to
      the operations necessary for them to pursue? Some plan of intercourse&mdash;some
      settled mode of communication must be concerted between them; a fact as
      well known to herself as to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;whatever&rsquo;s the reason of her not coming, I&rsquo;m
      sure the fault is not hers; as it is, there&rsquo;s no use in waitin&rsquo; this night
      any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flanagan, it appeared, was of the same opinion, for in a minute or two he
      made his appearance, and urged their return home. It was clear, he said,
      that no interview could take place that night, and the sooner they reached
      the barn and got to bed the better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Folly me,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;we can pass through the yard, cross the road before
      the hall-door, and get over the stile, by the near way through the fields
      that&rsquo;s behind the orchard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connor, who was by no means so well acquainted with the path as his
      companion, followed him in the way pointed out, and in a few minutes they
      found themselves walking at a brisk pace in a direction that led homewards
      by a shorter cut. Connor&rsquo;s mind was too much depressed for conversation,
      and both were proceeding in silence, when Flanagan started in alarm, and
      pointed out the figure of some one walking directly towards them. In less
      than a minute the person, whoever he might be, had come within speaking
      distance, and, as he shouted &ldquo;Who comes there?&rdquo; Flanagan bolted across the
      ditch, along which they had been going, and disappeared. &ldquo;A friend,&rdquo;
       returned Connor, in reply to the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other man advanced, and, with a look of deep scrutiny, peered into his
      face. &ldquo;A friend,&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;faith, it&rsquo;s, a quare hour for a friend to
      be out. Who are you, eh? Is this Connor O&rsquo;Donovan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is; but you have the advantage of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your father was here he would know Phil Curtis, any way.&lsquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to &lsquo;a known the voice myself,&rdquo; said Connor; &ldquo;Phil, how are you?
      an&rsquo; what&rsquo;s bringin&rsquo; yourself out at this hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I want to buy a couple o&rsquo; milk cows in the fair o&rsquo; Kilturbit, an&rsquo; 
      I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to catch my horse, an&rsquo; make ready. It&rsquo;s a stiff ride from this,
      an&rsquo; by the time I&rsquo;m there it I&rsquo;ll be late enough for business, I&rsquo;m
      thinkin&rsquo;. There was some one wid you; who was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said Connor, good&mdash;humoredly, &ldquo;he was out coortin&rsquo;, and
      doesn&rsquo;t wish to be known; and Phil, as you had the luck to meet me, I beg
      you, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, not to breathe that you seen me near Bodagh Buie&rsquo;s
      to-night; I have various reasons for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no secret to me as it is,&rdquo; replied Curtis; &ldquo;half the parish knows
      it; so make your mind asy on that head. Good night, Connor! I wish you
      success, anyhow; you&rsquo;ll be a happy man if you get her; although, from what
      I hear has happened, you have a bad chance, except herself stands to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The truth was, that Fardorougha&rsquo;s visit to the Bodagh, thanks to the high
      tones of his own shrill voice, had drawn female curiosity, already
      suspicious of the circumstances, to the keyhole of the parlor-door, where
      the issue and object of the conference soon became known. In a short time
      it had gone among the servants, and from them was transmitted, in the
      course of that and the following day, to the tenants and day-laborers! who
      contrived to multiply it with such effect, that, as Curtis said, it was
      indeed no secret to the greater part of the parish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flanagan soon rejoined Connor, who, on taxing him with his flight, was
      informed, with an appearance of much regret, that a debt of old standing
      due to Curtis had occasioned it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And upon my saunies, Connor, I&rsquo;d rather any time go up to my neck in
      wather than meet a man that I owe money to, whin I can&rsquo;t pay him. I knew
      Phil very well, even before he spoke, and that was what made me cut an&rsquo; 
      run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Connor, looking towards the east, &ldquo;can it be day-light so
      soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begad, it surely cannot,&rdquo; replied his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy mother above us, what is this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both involuntarily stood to contemplate the strange phenomenon which
      presented itself to their observation; and, as it was certainly both novel
      and startling in its appearance, we shall pause a little to describe it
      more minutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night, as we have already said, was remarkably dark, and warm to an
      unusual degree. To the astonishment, however, of our two travellers, a
      gleam of light, extremely faint, and somewhat resembling that which
      precedes the rising of a summer sun, broke upon their path, and passed on
      in undulating sweeps for a considerable space before them. Connor had
      scarcely time to utter the exclamation just alluded to, and Flanagan to
      reply to him, when the light around them shot farther into the distance
      and deepened from its first pale hue into a rich and gorgeous purple. Its
      effect, however, was limited within a circle of about a mile, for they
      could observe that it got faint gradually, from the centre to the extreme
      verge, where it melted into utter darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must mean something extraordinary,&rdquo; said Connor; &ldquo;whatever it is, it
      appears to be behind the hill that divides us from Bodagh&rsquo;s Buie&rsquo;s house.
      Blessed earth! it looks as if the sky was on fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sky, indeed, presented a fearful but sublime spectacle. One spot
      appeared to glow with the red-white heat of a furnace, and to form the
      centre of a fiery cupola, from which the flame was flung in redder and
      grosser masses, that darkened away into wild and dusky indistinctness, in
      a manner that corresponded with the same light, as it danced in red and
      frightful mirth upon the earth. As they looked, the cause of this awful
      phenomenon soon became visible. From behind the hill was seen a thick
      shower of burning particles rushing up into the mid air, and presently the
      broad point of a huge pyramid of fire, wavering in terrible and capricious
      power, seemed to disport itself far up in the very depths of the glowing
      sky. On looking again upon the earth they perceived that this terrible
      circle was extending itself over a wider circumference of country, marking
      every prominent object around them with a dark blood&mdash;red tinge, and
      throwing those that were more remote into a visionary but appalling
      relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Dhar Chriestha</i>,&rdquo; exclaimed Flanagan, &ldquo;I have it; thim I spoke
      about has paid Bodagh Buie the visit they promised him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come round the hip o&rsquo; the hill,&rdquo; said Connor, &ldquo;till we see where it
      really is; but I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Bartle, if you be right, woe betide
      you! all the water in Europe wouldn&rsquo;t wash you free in my mind, of being
      connected in this same Ribbon business that&rsquo;s spreading through the
      country. As sure as that sky&mdash;that fearful sky&rsquo;s above us, you must
      prove to me and other&rsquo;s how you came to know that this hellish business
      was to take place. God of heaven! let us run&mdash;surely it couldn&rsquo;t be
      the dwelling-house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His speed was so great that Bartle could find neither breath nor leisure
      to make any reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;oh, thank God it&rsquo;s not the house, and there
      lives are safe! but blessed Father, there&rsquo;s the man&rsquo;s whole haggard in
      flames!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the netarnal villains!&rdquo; was the simple exclamation of Flanagan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bartle,&rdquo; said his companion, &ldquo;you heard what I said this minute?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes met as he spoke, and for the first time O&rsquo;Donovan was struck by
      the pallid malignity of his features. The servant gazed steadily upon him,
      his lips slightly but firmly drawn back, and his eye, in which was neither
      sympathy nor alarm, charged with the spirit of a cool and devilish
      triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connor&rsquo;s blazed at the bare idea of his villainy, and, in a fit of manly
      and indignant rage, he seized Flanagan and hurled him headlong to the
      earth at his feet. &ldquo;You have hell in your face, you villain!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed; &ldquo;and if I thought that&mdash;if I did&mdash;I&rsquo;d drag you down
      like a dog, an&rsquo; pitch you head&mdash;foremost into the flames!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bartle rose, and, in a voice wonderfully calm, simply observed, &ldquo;God
      knows, Connor, if I know either your heart or mine, you&rsquo;ll be sorry for
      this treatment you&rsquo;ve given me for no rason. You know yourself that, as
      soon as I heard anything of the ill-will against the Bodagh, I tould it to
      you, in ordher&mdash;mark that&mdash;in ordher that you might let him know
      it the best way you thought proper; an&rsquo; for that you&rsquo;ve knocked me down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I believe you may be right, Bartle&mdash;there&rsquo;s truth in that&mdash;but
      I can&rsquo;t forgive you the look you gave me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That red light was in my face, maybe; I&rsquo;m sure if that wasn&rsquo;t it, I can&rsquo;t
      tell&mdash;I was myself wonderin&rsquo; at your own looks, the same way; but
      then it was that quare light that was in your face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, maybe I&rsquo;m wrong&mdash;I hope I am. Do you think we could be
      of any use there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of use! an&rsquo; how would we account for being there at all, Connor? how
      would you do it, at any rate, widout maybe bringin&rsquo; the girl into blame?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right agin, Bartle; I&rsquo;m not half so cool as you are; our best plan
      is to go home&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And go to bed; it is; an&rsquo; the sooner we&rsquo;re there the better; sowl,
      Connor, you gev me a murdherin&rsquo; crash.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think no more of it&mdash;think no more of it&mdash;I&rsquo;m not often hasty,
      so you must overlook it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was, however, with an anxious and distressed heart that Connor
      O&rsquo;Donovan reached his father&rsquo;s barn, where, in the same bed with Flanagan,
      he enjoyed, towards morning, a brief and broken slumber that brought back
      to his fancy images of blood and fire, all so confusedly mingled with Una,
      himself, and their parents, that the voice of his father calling upon them
      to rise, came to him as a welcome and manifest relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time laid in this story, neither burnings nor murders were so
      familiar nor patriotic, as the fancied necessity of working out political
      progress has recently made them. Such atrocities, in these bad and
      unreformed days, were certainly looked upon as criminal, rather than
      meritorious, however unpatriotic it may have been to form so erroneous an
      estimate of human villainy. The consequence of all this was, that the
      destruction of Bodagh Buie&rsquo;s property created a sensation in the country,
      of which, familiarized as we are to such crimes, we can entertain but a
      very faint notion. In three days a reward of five hundred pounds,
      exclusive of two hundred from government, was offered for such information
      as might bring the incendiary, or incendiaries, to justice. The Bodagh and
      his family were stunned as much with amazement at the occurrence of a
      calamity so incomprehensible to them, as with the loss they had sustained,
      for that indeed was heavy. The man was extremely popular, and by many acts
      of kindness had won the attachment and goodwill of all who knew him,
      either personally or by character. How, then, account for an act so wanton
      and vindictive? They could not understand it; it was not only a&mdash;crime,
      but a crime connected with some mysterious motive, beyond their power to
      detect.
    </p>
    <p>
      But of all who became acquainted with the outrage, not one sympathized
      more sincerely and deeply with O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s family than did Connor O&rsquo;Donovan;
      although, of course, that sympathy was unknown to those for whom it was
      felt. The fact was, that his own happiness became, in some degree,
      involved in their calamity; and, as he came in to breakfast on the fourth
      morning of its occurrence, he could not help observing as much to his
      mother. His suspicions of Flanagan, as to possessing some clue to the
      melancholy business, were by no means removed. On the contrary, he felt
      that he ought to have him brought before the bench of magistrates who were
      conducting the investigation from day to day, and, with this
      determination, he himself resolved to state fully and candidly to the
      bench, all the hints which had transpired from Flanagan respecting the
      denunciations said to be held out against O&rsquo;Brien and the causes assigned
      for them. Breakfast was now ready, and Fardorougha himself entered,
      uttering petulant charges of neglect and idleness against his servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He desarves no breakfast,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;not a morsel; it&rsquo;s robbin&rsquo; me by his
      idleness and schaming he is. What is he doin&rsquo;, Connor? or what has become
      of him? He&rsquo;s not in the field nor about the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connor paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, now that I think of it, I didn&rsquo;t see him to-day,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;I
      thought that he was mendin&rsquo; the slap at the Three-Acres. I&rsquo;ll thry if he&rsquo;s
      in the barn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he went accordingly to find him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, father,&rdquo; said he, on his
      return, &ldquo;that Bartle&rsquo;s a bad boy, an&rsquo; a dangerous one; he&rsquo;s not in the
      barn, an&rsquo; it appears, from the bed, that he didn&rsquo;t sleep there last night.
      The truth is, he&rsquo;s gone; at laste he has brought all his clothes, his box,
      an&rsquo; everything with him; an&rsquo; what&rsquo;s more, I suspect the reason of it; he
      thinks he has let out too much to me; an&rsquo; it &lsquo;ill go hard but I&rsquo;ll make
      him let out more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The servant-maid, Biddy, now entered and informed them that four men,
      evidently strangers, were approaching the house from the rear, and ere she
      could add anything further on the subject, two of them walked in, and,
      seizing Connor, informed him that he was their prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your prisoner!&rdquo; exclaimed his mother, getting pale; &ldquo;why, what could our
      poor boy do to make him your prisoner? He never did hurt or harm to the
      child unborn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fardorougha&rsquo;s keen gray eye rested sharply upon them for a moment; it then
      turned to Honor, afterwards to Connor, and again gleamed bitterly at the
      intruders&mdash;&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; said he, starting up; &ldquo;what is this? you
      don&rsquo;t mane to rob us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said the son, &ldquo;you must be undher a mistake; you surely can
      have no business with me. It&rsquo;s very likely you want some one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; inquired he who appeared to be the principal of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Connor O&rsquo;Donovan; an&rsquo; I know no reason why I should deny it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are the very man we come for,&rdquo; said the querist, &ldquo;so you had
      better prepare to accompany us; in the mean time you must excuse us if we
      search your room. This is unpleasant, I grant, but we have no discretion,
      and must perform our duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want in this room?&rdquo; said Fardorougha; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s robbery you&rsquo;re on
      for&mdash;it&rsquo;s robbery you&rsquo;re on for&mdash;in open daylight, too; but
      you&rsquo;re late; I lodged the last penny yesterday; that&rsquo;s one comfort; you&rsquo;re
      late&mdash;you&rsquo;re late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did my boy do?&rdquo; exclaimed the affrighted mother; &ldquo;what did he do
      that you come to drag him away from us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This question she put to the other constable, the first having entered her
      son&rsquo;s bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid, ma&rsquo;am, you&rsquo;ll know it too soon,&rdquo; replied the man; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a
      heavy charge if it proves to be true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke his companion re-entered the apartment, with Connor&rsquo;s Sunday
      coat in his hand, from the pocket of which he drew a steel and tinder-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for this,&rdquo; he observed; &ldquo;it corroborates what has been sworn
      against you by your accomplice, and here, I fear, comes additional proof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment the other two made their appearance, one of them
      holding in his hand the shoes which Connor had lent to Flanagan, and which
      he wore on the night of the conflagration.
    </p>
    <p>
      On seeing this, and comparing the two circumstances together, a fearful
      light broke on the unfortunate young man, who had already felt conscious
      of the snare into which he had fallen. With an air of sorrow and manly
      resignation he thus addressed his parents:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed; I see that there is an attempt made to swear away my
      life; but, whatever happens, you both know that I am innocent of doin&rsquo; an
      injury to any one. If I die, I would rather die innocent than live as
      guilty as he will that must have my blood to answer for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His mother, on hearing this, ran to him, and with her arms about his neck,
      exclaimed,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Die! die! Connor darlin&rsquo;&mdash;my brave boy&mdash;my only son&mdash;why
      do you talk about death? What is it for? what is it about? Oh, for the
      love of God, tell us what did our boy do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is charged by Bartle Flanagan,&rdquo; replied one of the constables, &ldquo;with
      burning Bodagh Buie O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s haggard, because he refused him his
      daughter. He must now come with us to jail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see the whole plot,&rdquo; said Connor, &ldquo;and a deep one it is; the villain
      will do his worst; still I can&rsquo;t but have dependence upon justice and my
      own innocence. I can&rsquo;t but have dependence upon God, who knows my heart.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      PART IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fardorougha stood amazed and confounded, looking from one to another like
      a man who felt incapable of comprehending all that had passed before him.
      His forehead, over which fell a few gray thin locks, assumed a deadly
      paleness, and his eye lost the piercing expression which usually
      characterized it. He threw his Cothamore several times over his shoulders,
      as he had been in the habit of doing when about to proceed after breakfast
      to his usual avocations, and as often laid it aside, without being at all
      conscious of what he did. His limbs appeared to get feeble, and his hands
      trembled as if he labored under palsy. In this mood he passed from one to
      another, sometimes seizing a constable by the arm with a hard, tremulous
      grip, and again suddenly letting go his hold of him without speaking. At
      length a singular transition from this state of mind became apparent; a
      gleam of wild exultation shot from his eye; his sallow and blasted
      features brightened; the Cothamore was buttoned under his chin with a
      rapid energy of manner evidently arising from the removal of some secret
      apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no robbery; it&rsquo;s not robbery afther all; but
      how could it? there&rsquo;s no money here; not a penny; an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m belied, at any
      rate; for there&rsquo;s not a poorer man in the barony&mdash;thank God, it&rsquo;s not
      robbery!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Fardorougha,&rdquo; said the wife, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you see they&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to take him
      away from us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take who away from us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor, your own Connor&mdash;our boy&mdash;the light of my heart&mdash;the
      light of his poor mother&rsquo;s heart! Oh, Connor, Connor, what is it they&rsquo;re
      goin&rsquo; to do to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No harm, mother, I trust; no harm&mdash;don&rsquo;t be frightened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man put his open hands to his temples, which he pressed bitterly,
      and with all his force, for nearly half a minute. He had, in truth, been
      alarmed into the very worst mood of his habitual vice, apprehension
      concerning his money; and felt that nothing, except a powerful effort,
      could succeed in drawing his attention to the scene which was passing
      before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;what is it that&rsquo;s wrong wid Connor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must come to jail,&rdquo; said one of the men, looking at him with surprise;
      &ldquo;we have already stated the crime for which he stands committed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To jail! Connor O&rsquo;Donovan to jail!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too true, father; Bartle Flanagan has sworn that I burned Mr.
      O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s haggard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor, Connor,&rdquo; said the old man, approaching him as he spoke, and
      putting his arms composedly about his neck, &ldquo;Connor, my brave boy, my
      brave boy, it wasn&rsquo;t you did it; &lsquo;twas I did it,&rdquo; he added, turning to the
      constables; &ldquo;lave him, lave him wid her, an&rsquo; take me in his place! Who
      would if I would not&mdash;who ought, I say&mdash;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll do it&mdash;take
      me; I&rsquo;ll go in his place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connor looked down upon the old man, and as he saw his heart rent, and his
      reason absolutely tottering, a sense of the singular and devoted affection
      which he had ever borne him, overcame him, and with a full heart he dashed
      away a tear from his eye, and pressed his father to his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;this will kill the old man; it will kill him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fardorougha, a hagur,&rdquo; said Ha wife, feeling it necessary to sustain him
      as much as possible, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t take it so much to heart, it won&rsquo;t signify&mdash;Connor&rsquo;s
      innocent, an&rsquo; no harm will happen to him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But are you lavin&rsquo; us, Connor? are they&mdash;must they bring you to
      jail?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a while, father; but I won&rsquo;t be long there I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an unpleasant duty on our part,&rdquo; said the principal of them; &ldquo;still
      it&rsquo;s one we must perform. Your father should lose no time in taking the
      proper steps for your defence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what are we to do?&rdquo; asked the mother; &ldquo;God knows the boy&rsquo;s as
      innocent as I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Fardorougha, still upon dwelling the resolution he had made;
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go stand for you, Connor; you won&rsquo;t let them bring me instead of
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s out of the question,&rdquo; replied the constable; &ldquo;the law suffers
      nothing of the kind to take place; but if you will be advised by me, lose
      no time in preparing to defend him. It would be unjust to disguise the
      matter from you, or to keep you ignorant of its being a case of life and
      death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Life and death! what do you mane?&rdquo; asked Fardorougha, staring vacantly at
      the last speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s painful to distress you; but if he&rsquo;s found guilty, it&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Death! hanged!&rdquo; shrieked the old man, awaking as it were for the first
      time to a full perception of his son&rsquo;s situation; &ldquo;hanged! my boy hanged!
      Connor, Connor, don&rsquo;t go from me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll die wid him,&rdquo; said the mother; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll die wid you, Connor. We
      couldn&rsquo;t live widout him,&rdquo; she added, addressing the strangers; &ldquo;as God is
      in heaven we couldn&rsquo;t! Oh Connor, Connor, avourneen, what is it that has
      come over us, and brought us to this sorrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mother&rsquo;s grief then flowed on, accompanied by a burst of that
      unstudied, but pathetic eloquence, which in Ireland is frequently uttered
      in the tone of wail and lamentation peculiar to those who mourn over the
      dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she added, with her arms tenderly about him, and her streaming eyes
      fixed with a wild and mournful look of despair upon his face; &ldquo;no, he is
      in his loving mother&rsquo;s arms, the boy that never gave to his father or me a
      harsh word or a sore heart! Long were we lookin&rsquo; for him, an&rsquo; little did
      we think it was for this heavy fate that the goodness of God sent him to
      us! Oh, many a look of lovin&rsquo; affection, many a happy heart did he give
      us! Many a time Connor, avillish, did I hang over your cradle, and draw
      out to myself the happiness and the good that I hoped was before you. You
      wor too good&mdash;too good, I doubt&mdash;to be long in such a world as
      this, an&rsquo; no wondher that the heart of the fair young colleen, the heart
      of the <i>Colleen dhas dhun</i> should rest upon you and love you; for who
      ever knew you that didn&rsquo;t? Isn&rsquo;t there enough, King of heaven! enough of
      the bad an&rsquo; the wicked in this world for the law to punish, an&rsquo; not to
      take the innocent&mdash;not to take away from us the only one&mdash;the
      only one&mdash;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;but if they do&mdash;Connor&mdash;if
      they do, your lovin&rsquo; mother will die wid you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stern officers of justice wiped their eyes, and were proceeding to
      afford such consolation as they could, when Fardorougha, who had sat down
      after having made way for Honor to recline on the bosom of their son, now
      rose, and seizing the breast of his coat, was about to speak, but ere he
      could utter a word he tottered, and, would have instantly fallen, had not
      Connor caught him in his arms. This served for a moment to divert the
      mother&rsquo;s grief, and to draw her attention from the son to the husband, who
      was now insensible. He was carried to the door by Connor; but when they
      attempted to lay him in a recumbent posture, it was found almost
      impossible to unclasp the deathlike grip which he held of the coat. His
      haggard face was shrunk and collapsed; the individual features sharp and
      thin, but earnest and stamped with traces of alarm; his brows, too, which
      were slightly knit, gave to his whole countenance a character of keen and
      painful determination. But that which struck those who were present, most,
      was the unyielding grasp with which he clung even in his insensibility to
      the person of Connor.
    </p>
    <p>
      If not an affecting sight, it was one at least strongly indicative of the
      intractable and indurated attachment which put itself forth with such
      vague and illusive energy on behalf of his son. At length he recovered,
      and on opening his eyes he fixed them with a long look of pain and
      distraction upon the boy&rsquo;s countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Connor, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be cast down&mdash;you need not&mdash;and
      you ought not to be so much disheartened&mdash;do you feel better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the father heard his voice he smiled; yes&mdash;his shrunk, pale,
      withered face was lit up by a wild, indescribable ecstasy, whose startling
      expression waa borrowed, one would think, as much from the light of
      insanity as from that of returning consciousness. He sucked in his thin
      cheeks, smacked his parched, skinny lips, and with difficulty called for
      drink. Having swallowed a little water, he looked round him with more
      composure, and inquired&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened me? am I robbed? are you robbers? But I tell you
      there&rsquo;s no money in the house. I lodged the last penny yesterday&mdash;afore
      my God I did&mdash;but&mdash;oh, what am I sayin&rsquo;? what is this, Connor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father dear, compose yourself&mdash;we&rsquo;ll get over this throuble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will, darlin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Honor, wiping the pale brows of her husband; &ldquo;an&rsquo; 
      we won&rsquo;t lose him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, achora,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;no, we won&rsquo;t lose him! Connor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, father dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a thing here&mdash;here&rdquo;&mdash;and he placed his hand upon his
      heart&mdash;&ldquo;something it is that makes me afeard&mdash;a sinkin&rsquo;&mdash;a
      weight&mdash;and there&rsquo;s a strugglin&rsquo;, too, Connor. I know I can&rsquo;t stand
      it long&mdash;an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s about you&mdash;it&rsquo;s all about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You distress yourself too much, father; indeed you do. Why, I hoped that
      you would comfort my poor mother till I come back to her and you, as I
      will, plase God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;yes, I will, I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better prepare,&rdquo; said one of the officers; &ldquo;the sooner this is
      over the better&mdash;he&rsquo;s a feeble man and not very well able to bear
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said Connor; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t delay many minutes; I have only to
      change my clothes, an&rsquo; I am ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a short time he made his appearance dressed in his best suit; and,
      indeed, it would be extremely difficult to meet, in any rank of life, a
      finer specimen of vigor, activity, and manly beauty. His countenance, at
      all times sedate and open, was on this occasion shaded by an air of
      profound melancholy that gave a composed grace and dignity to his whole
      bearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, father,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;before I go, I think it right to lave you and my
      poor mother all the consolation I can. In the presence of God, in yours,
      in my dear mother&rsquo;s, and in the presence of all who hear me, I am as
      innocent of the crime that&rsquo;s laid to my charge as the babe unborn. That&rsquo;s
      a comfort for you to know, and let it prevent you from frettin&rsquo;; and now,
      good by; God be with you, and strengthen, and support you both!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fardorougha had already seized his hand; but the old man could neither
      speak nor weep; his whole frame appeared to have been suddenly pervaded by
      a dry agony that suspended the beatings of his very heart. The mother&rsquo;s
      grief, on the contrary, was loud, and piercing, and vehement. She threw
      herself once more upon his neck; she kissed his lips, she pressed him to
      her heart, and poured out as before the wail of a wild and hopeless
      misery. At length, by the aid of some slight but necessary force, her arms
      were untwined from about his neck; and Connor then, stooping, embraced his
      father, and, gently placing him on a settle&mdash;bed, bade him farewell!
      On reaching the door he paused, and, turning about, surveyed his mother
      struggling in the hands of one of the officers to get embracing him again,
      and his gray&mdash;haired father sitting in speechless misery on the
      settle. He stood a moment to look upon them, and a few bitter tears
      rolled, in the silence of manly sorrow, down his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Fardorougha!&rdquo; exclaimed his mother, after they had gone, &ldquo;sure it
      isn&rsquo;t merely for partin&rsquo; wid him that we feel so heart&mdash;broken. He
      may never stand under this roof again, an&rsquo; he all we have and had to
      love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned Fardorougha, quietly; &ldquo;no, it&rsquo;s not, as you say, for merely
      partin&rsquo; wid him&mdash;hanged! God! God! Mm&mdash;here&mdash;Honor&mdash;here,
      the thought of it&mdash;I&rsquo;ll die&mdash;it&rsquo;ll break! Oh, God support me! my
      heart&mdash;here&mdash;my heart&rsquo;ll break! My brain, too, and my head&mdash;oh!
      if God &lsquo;ud take me before I&rsquo;d see it! But it can&rsquo;t be&mdash;it&rsquo;s not
      possible that our innocent boy should meet sich a death!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear, it is not; sure he&rsquo;s innocent&mdash;that&rsquo;s one comfort; but,
      Fardorougha, as the men said, you must go to a lawyer and see what can be
      done to defind him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man rose up and proceeded to his son&rsquo;s bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honor,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;come here;&rdquo; and while uttering these words he gazed
      upon her face with a look of unutterable and hopeless distress; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
      his bed, Honor&mdash;his bed&mdash;he may never sleep on it more&mdash;he
      may be cut down like a flower in his youth&mdash;an&rsquo; then what will become
      of us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forever, from this day out,&rdquo; said the distracted mother, &ldquo;no hands will
      ever make it but my own; on no other will I sleep&mdash;we will both sleep&mdash;where
      his head lay there will mine be too&mdash;avick machree&mdash;machree!
      Och, Fardorougha, we can&rsquo;t stand this; let us not take it to heart, as we
      do; let us trust in God, an&rsquo; hope for the best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Honor, in fact, found it necessary to assume the office of a comforter;
      but it was clear that nothing urged or suggested by her could for a moment
      win back the old man&rsquo;s heart from the contemplation of the loss of his
      son. He moped about for a considerable time; but, ever and anon, found
      himself in Connor&rsquo;s bedroom, looking upon his clothes and such other
      memorials of him as it contained.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the occurrence of these melancholy incidents at Fardorougha&rsquo;s,
      others of a scarcely less distressing character were passing under the
      roof of Bodagh Buie O&rsquo;Brien.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our readers need not be informed that the charge brought by Bartle
      Flanagan against Connor, excited the utmost amazement in all who heard it.
      So much at variance were his untarnished reputation and amiable manners
      with a disposition so dark and malignant as that which must have prompted
      the perpetration of such a crime, that it was treated at first by the
      public as an idle rumor. The evidence, however, of Phil Curtis, and his
      deposition to the conversation which occurred between him and Connor, at
      the time and place already known to the reader, together with the
      corroborating circumstances arising from the correspondence of the
      footprints about the haggard with the shoes produced by the constable&mdash;all,
      when combined together, left little doubt of his guilt. No sooner had this
      impression become general, than the spirit of the father was immediately
      imputed to the son, and many sagacious observations made, all tending to
      show, that, as they expressed it, &ldquo;the bad drop of the old rogue would
      sooner or later come out in the young one;&rdquo; &ldquo;he wouldn&rsquo;t be what he was,
      or the bitter heart of the miser would appear;&rdquo; with many other apothegms
      of similar import. The family of the Bodagh, however, were painfully and
      peculiarly circumstanced. With the exception of Una herself, none of them
      entertained a doubt that Connor was the incendiary. Flanagan had
      maintained a good character, and his direct impeachment of Connor,
      supported by such exact circumstantial evidence, left nothing to be urged
      in the young man&rsquo;s defence. Aware as they were of the force of Una&rsquo;s
      attachment, and apprehensive that the shock, arising from the discovery of
      his atrocity, might be dangerous if injudiciously disclosed to her, they
      resolved, in accordance with the suggestion of their son, to break the
      matter to herself with the utmost delicacy and caution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is better,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;that she should hear of the misfortune from
      ourselves; for, after breaking it to her as gently as possible, we can at
      least attempt to strengthen and console her under it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven above sees,&rdquo; exclaimed his mother, &ldquo;that it was a black and
      unlucky business to her and to all of us; but now that she knows what a
      revingeful villain he is, I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll not find it hard to banish him
      out of her thoughts. <i>Deah Grasthias</i> for the escape she had from him
      at any rate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John, bring her in,&rdquo; said the father; &ldquo;bring the unfortunate young
      crature in. I can&rsquo;t but pity her, Bridget; I can&rsquo;t but pity ma colleen
      voghth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Una entered with her brother she perceived by a glance at the solemn
      bearing of her parents, that some unhappy announcement was about to be
      made to her. She sat down, therefore, with a beating heart and a cheek
      already pale with apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Una,&rdquo; said her father, &ldquo;we sent for you to mention a circumstance that we
      would rather you should hear from ourselves than from strangers. You were
      always a good girl, Una&mdash;an&rsquo; obadient girl, and sensible beyant your
      years; and I trust that your good sinse and the grace of the Almighty will
      enable you to bear up undher any disappointment that may come upon you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, father, there can be nothing worse than I know already,&rdquo; she
      replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what do you know, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only what you told me the day Fardorougha was here, that nothing
      agreeable to my wishes could take place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would give a great deal that the business was now as it was even then,&rdquo;
       responded her father; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s far worse to come, Una, an&rsquo; you must be
      firm, an&rsquo; prepare to hear what&rsquo;ll thry you sorely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t guess it, father; but for God&rsquo;s sake tell me at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who do you think burned our property?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I suppose if she hadn&rsquo;t been undher the one roof wid us that it&rsquo;s
      ourselves he&rsquo;d burn,&rdquo; observed her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, tell me the worst at once&mdash;whatever it may be;&mdash;how
      could I guess the villain or villains who destroyed our property?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Villain, indeed! you may well say so,&rdquo; returned the Bodagh. &ldquo;That villain
      is no other than Connor O&rsquo;Donovan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Una felt as if a weighty burden had been removed from her heart; she
      breathed freely; her depression and alarm vanished, and her dark eye
      kindled into proud confidence in the integrity of her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, father,&rdquo; she asked, in a full and firm voice, &ldquo;is there nothing
      worse than that to come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse! is the girl&rsquo;s brain turned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Dhar a Lhora Heena</i>, she&rsquo;s as mad I believe as ould Fardorougha
      himself,&rdquo; said the mother; &ldquo;worse! why, she has parted wid all the reasing
      she ever had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, mother, I hope I have not, and that my reason&rsquo;s as clear as ever;
      but, as to Connor O&rsquo;Donovan, he&rsquo;s innocent of that charge, and of every
      other that may be brought against him; I don&rsquo;t believe it, and I never
      will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s proved against him; it&rsquo;s brought, home to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s his accuser?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His father&rsquo;s servant, Bartle Flanagan, has turned king&rsquo;s evidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deep-dyed villain!&rdquo; she exclaimed, with indignation; &ldquo;father, of that
      crime, so sure as God&rsquo;s in heaven, so sure is Connor O&rsquo;Donovan innocent,
      and so sure is Bartle Flanagan guilty&mdash;I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know it&mdash;explain yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean I feel it&mdash;ay, home to the core of my heart&mdash;my unhappy
      heart&mdash;I feel the truth of what I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Una,&rdquo; observed her brother, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you have been vilely deceived by
      him&mdash;there&rsquo;s not the slightest doubt of his guilt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you be deceived, John; I say he&rsquo;s innocent&mdash;as I hope for
      heaven he&rsquo;s innocent; and, father, I&rsquo;m not a bit cast down or disheartened
      by anything I have yet heard against him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a very extraordinary girl, Una; but for my part I&rsquo;m glad you look
      upon it as you do. If his innocence appears, no man alive will be better
      plazed at it than myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His innocence will appear,&rdquo; exclaimed the faithful girl; &ldquo;it must appear;
      and,&mdash;father, mark this&mdash;I say the time will tell yet who is
      innocent and who is guilty. God knows,&rdquo; she added, her energy of manner
      increasing, while a shower of hot tears fell down her cheeks, &ldquo;God knows I
      would marry him to-morrow with the disgrace of that and ten times as much
      upon him, so certain am I that his heart and hand are free from thought or
      deed that&rsquo;s either treacherous or dishonorable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marry him!&rdquo; said her brother, losing temper; &ldquo;nobody doubts but you&rsquo;d
      marry him on the gallows, wid the rope about his neck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would do it, and unite myself to a true heart. Don&rsquo;t mistake me, and
      mother, dear, don&rsquo;t blame me,&rdquo; she added, her tears flowing still faster;
      &ldquo;he&rsquo;s in disgrace&mdash;sunk in shame and sorrow&mdash;and I won&rsquo;t conceal
      the force of what I feel for him; I won&rsquo;t desert him now as the world will
      do; I know his heart, and on the scaffold to-morrow I would become his
      wife, if it would take away one atom of his misery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s innocent,&rdquo; said her father, &ldquo;you have more pinetration than any
      girl in Europe; but if he&rsquo;s guilty of such an act against any one
      connected with you, Una, the guilt of all the divils in hell is no match
      for his. Well, you have heard all we wanted to say to you, and you needn&rsquo;t
      stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As she herself says,&rdquo; observed John, &ldquo;perhaps time will place everything
      in its true light. At present all those who are not in love with him have
      little doubt of his guilt. However, even as it is, in principle Una is
      right; putting love out of the question, we should prejudge no one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time will,&rdquo; said his sister, &ldquo;or rather God will in His own good time. On
      God I&rsquo;m sure he depends; on his providence I also rely for seeing his name
      and character cleared of all that has been brought against him. John, I
      wish to speak to you in my own room; not that I intend to make any secret
      of it, but I want to consult with you first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Cheerna dheelish</i>,&rdquo; exclaimed her mother; &ldquo;what a wife that child
      would make to any man that desarved her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more than I&rsquo;m able to do, to be angry with her,&rdquo; returned the
      Bodagh. &ldquo;Did you ever know her to tell a lie, Bridget?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lie! no, nor the shadow of a lie never came out of her lips; the
      desate&rsquo;s not in her; an&rsquo; may God look down on her wid compunction this
      day; for there&rsquo;s a dark road I doubt before her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; responded her father; &ldquo;amen, I pray the Saviour. At all evints,
      O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s guilt or innocence will soon be known,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;the &lsquo;sizes
      begin this day week, so that the business will soon be settled either one
      way or other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Una, on reaching her own room, thus addressed her affectionate brother:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, John, you know that my grandfather left rue two hundred guineas in
      his will, and you know, too, the impossibility of getting any money from
      the clutches of Pardorougha. You must see Connor, and find out how he
      intends to defend himself. If his father won&rsquo;t allow him sufficient means
      to employ the best lawyers&mdash;as I doubt whether he will or not&mdash;just
      tell him the truth, that whilst I have a penny of these two hundred
      guineas, he mustn&rsquo;t want money; an&rsquo; tell him, too, that all the world
      won&rsquo;t persuade me that he&rsquo;s guilty; say I know him to be innocent, and
      that his disgrace has made him dearer to me than he ever was before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, you can&rsquo;t suppose for a moment, my dear Una, that I, your
      brother, who, by the way, have never opened my lips to him, could
      deliberately convey such a message.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be conveyed in some manner; I&rsquo;m resolved on that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best plan,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;is to find out whatsoever attorney they
      employ, and then to discover, if possible, whether his father has
      furnished sufficient funds for his defence. If he has, your offer is
      unnecessary; and if not, a private arrangement may be made with the
      attorney of which nobody else need know anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you, John! God bless you!&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;that is far better;
      you have been a good brother to your poor Una&mdash;to your poor unhappy
      Una!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned her head on a table, and wept for some time at the trying fate,
      as she termed it, which hung over two beings so young and so guiltless of
      any crime. The brother soothed her by every argument in his power, and,
      after gently compelling her to dry her tears, expressed his intention of
      going early the next day to ascertain whether or not any professional man
      had been engaged to conduct the defence of her unfortunate lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      In effecting this object there was little time lost on the part of young
      O&rsquo;Brien. Knowing that two respectable attorneys lived in the next market
      town, he deemed it best to ascertain whether Fardorougha had applied to
      either of them for the purposes aforementioned, or, if not, to assure
      himself whether the old man had gone to any of those pettifoggers, who,
      rather than appear without practice, will undertake a cause almost on any
      terms, and afterwards institute a lawsuit for the recovery of a much
      larger bill of costs than a man of character and experience would demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      In pursuance of the plan concerted between them, the next morning found
      him rapping, about eleven o&rsquo;clock, at the door of an attorney named
      Kennedy, whom he asked to see on professional business. A clerk, on
      hearing his voice in the hall, came out and requestedm him to step into a
      back room, adding that his master, who was engaged, would see him the
      moment he had despatched the person then with him. Thus shown, he was
      separated from O&rsquo;Halloran&rsquo;s office only by a pair of folding doors,
      through which every word uttered in the office could be distinctly heard;
      a circumstance that enabled O&rsquo;Brien unintentionally to overhear the
      following dialogue between the parties:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my good friend,&rdquo; said Kennedy to the stranger, who, it appeared,
      had arrived before O&rsquo;Brien only a few minutes, &ldquo;I am now disengaged; pray,
      let me know your business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger paused a moment, as if seeking the most appropriate terms in
      which to express himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a black business,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and the worst of it is I&rsquo;m a poor
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should not go to law, then,&rdquo; observed the attorney. &ldquo;I tell you
      beforehand you will find it is devilish expensive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s open robbery; I know what it cost me to
      recover the little pences that wor sometimes due to me, when I broke
      myself lending weeny trifles to strugglin&rsquo; people that I thought honest,
      and robbed me aftherwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way can my services be of use to you at present? for that I
      suppose is the object of your calling upon me,&rdquo; said Kennedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh thin, sir, if you have the grace of God, or kindness, or pity in your
      heart, you can sarve me, you can save my heart from breakin&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&mdash;how, man?&mdash;come to the point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son, sir, Connor, my only son, was taken away from his mother an&rsquo; me,
      an&rsquo; put into jail yesterday mornin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; he innocent; he was put in, sir,
      for burnin&rsquo; Bodagh Buie O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s haggard, an&rsquo; as God is above me, he as
      much burnt it as you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are Fardorougha Donovan,&rdquo; said the attorney; &ldquo;I have heard of
      that outrage; and, to be plain with you, a good deal about yourself. How,
      in the name of heaven, can you call yourself a poor man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They belie me, sir, they&rsquo;re bitther enemies that say I&rsquo;m otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be you rich or be you poor, let me tell you that I would not stand in
      your son&rsquo;s situation for the wealth of the king&rsquo;s exchequer. Sell your
      last cow; your last coat; your last acre; sell the bed from under you,
      without loss of time, if you wish to save his life; and I tell you that
      for this purpose you must employ the best counsel, and plenty of them. The
      Assizes commence on this day week, so that you have not a single moment to
      lose. Think now whether you love your son or your money best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saver of earth, amn&rsquo;t I an unhappy man! every one sayin&rsquo; I have money,
      an&rsquo; me has not! Where would I get it? Where would a man like me get it?
      Instead o&rsquo; that, I&rsquo;m so poor that I see plainly I&rsquo;ll starve yet; I see
      it&rsquo;s before me! God pity me this day! But agin, there&rsquo;s my boy, my boy;
      oh, God, pity him! Say what&rsquo;s the laste, the lowest, the very lowest you
      could take, for defendin&rsquo; him; an&rsquo; for pity&rsquo;s sake, for charity&rsquo;s sake,
      for God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t grind a poor, helpless, ould man by extortion. If
      you knew the boy&mdash;if you knew him&mdash;oh, afore my God, if you knew
      him, you wouldn&rsquo;t be apt to charge a penny; you&rsquo;d be proud to sarve sich a
      boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish everything possible to be done for him, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of coorse, of coorse; but widout extravagance; as asy an&rsquo; light on a poor
      man as you can. You could shorten it, sure, an&rsquo; lave out a grate dale that
      &lsquo;ud be of no use; nu&rsquo; half the paper &lsquo;ud do; for you might make the clerks
      write close&mdash;why, very little &lsquo;ud be wanted if you wor savin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can defend him with one counsel if you wish; but, if anxious to save
      the boy&rsquo;s life, you ought to enable your attorney to secure a strong bar
      of the most eminent lawyers he can engage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; what &lsquo;ud it cost to hire three or four of them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole expenses might amount to between thirty and forty guineas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A deep groan of dismay, astonishment, and anguish, was the only reply made
      to this for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, heavens above!&rdquo; he screamed, &ldquo;what will&mdash;what will become of me!
      I&rsquo;d rather be dead, as I&rsquo;ll soon be, than hear this, or know it at all.
      How could I get it? I&rsquo;m as poor as poverty itself! Oh, couldn&rsquo;t you feel
      for the boy, an&rsquo; defend him on trust; couldn&rsquo;t you feel for him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your business to do that,&rdquo; returned the man of law, coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feel for him; me! oh, little you know how my heart&rsquo;s in him; but any way,
      I&rsquo;m an unhappy man; everything in the world wide goes against me; but&mdash;oh,
      my darlin&rsquo; boy&mdash;Connor, Connor, my son, to be tould that I don&rsquo;t feel
      for you&mdash;well you know, avourneen machree&mdash;well you know that I
      feel for you, and &lsquo;ud kiss the track of your feet upon the ground: Oh,
      it&rsquo;s cruel to tell it to me; to say sich a thing to a man that his heart&rsquo;s
      braakin&rsquo; widin him for your sake; but, sir, you sed this minute that you
      could defend him wid one lawyer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, and with a cheap one, too, if you wish; but, in that case, I
      would rather decline the thing altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? why? sure if you can defind him chapely, isn&rsquo;t it so much saved?
      isn&rsquo;t it the same as if you definded him at a higher rate? Sure, if one
      lawyer tells the truth for the poor boy, ten or fifteen can do no more;
      an&rsquo; thin maybe they&rsquo;d crass in an&rsquo; puzzle one another if you hired too
      many of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How would you feel, should your son be found guilty; you know the penalty
      is his life. He will be executed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      O&rsquo;Brien could hear the old man clap his hands in agony, and in truth he
      walked about wringing them as if his heart would burst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will I do?&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;what will I do? I can&rsquo;t lose him, an&rsquo; I
      won&rsquo;t lose him! Lose him! oh God, oh God, it is to lose the best son and
      only child that ever man had! Wouldn&rsquo;t it be downright murdher in me to
      let him be lost if I could prevint it? Oh, if I was in his place, what
      wouldn&rsquo;t he do for me, for the father that he always loved!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tears ran copiously down his furrowed cheeks; and his whole appearance
      evinced such distraction and anguish as could rarely be witnessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you fifty guineas after
      my death if you&rsquo;ll defind him properly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much obliged,&rdquo; replied the other; &ldquo;but in matters of this kind we make no
      such bargains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make it sixty, in case you don&rsquo;t axe it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you give me security that I&rsquo;ll survive you? Why, you are
      tough-looking enough to outlive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me tough!&mdash;no, God help me, my race is nearly ran; I won&rsquo;t be alive
      this day twelve months&mdash;look at the differ atween us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is idle talk,&rdquo; said the attorney; &ldquo;determine on what you&rsquo;ll do;
      really my time is valuable, and I am now wasting it to no purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the offer&mdash;depind on&rsquo;t it&rsquo;ll soon come to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said the other, coolly; &ldquo;not at all; we might shut up shop if we
      made such <i>post obit</i> bargains as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; said Fardorougha; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what;&rdquo; his eyes gleamed
      with a reddish, bitter light; and he clasped his withered hands together,
      until the joints cracked, and the perspiration teemed from his pale,
      sallow features; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; he added&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make it seventy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aighty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ninety!&rdquo;&mdash;with a husky shriek
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundhre&rsquo;&mdash;a hundhre&rsquo;&mdash;a hundhre&rsquo;,&rdquo; he shouted; &ldquo;a hundhre&rsquo;,
      when I&rsquo;m gone&mdash;when I&rsquo;m gone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One solemn and determined No, that precluded all hopes of any such
      arrangement, was the only reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man leaped up again, and looked impatiently and wildly and
      fiercely about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you?&rdquo; he shouted; &ldquo;what are you? You&rsquo;re a divil&mdash;a born
      divil. Will nothing but my death satisfy you? Do you want to rob me&mdash;to
      starve me&mdash;to murdher me? Don&rsquo;t you see the state I&rsquo;m in by you? Look
      at me&mdash;look at these thremblin&rsquo; limbs&mdash;look at the sweat
      powerin&rsquo; down from my poor ould face! What is it you want? There&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      my gray hairs to you. You have brought me to that&mdash;to more than that&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      dyin&rsquo; this minute&mdash;I&rsquo;m dyin&rsquo;&mdash;oh, my boy&mdash;my boy, if I had
      you here&mdash;ay, I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He staggered over on his seat, his eyes gleaming in a fixed and intense
      glare at the attorney; his hands were clenched, his lips parched, and his
      mummy-like cheeks sucked, as before, into his toothless jaws. In addition
      to all this, there was a bitter white smile of despair upon his features,
      and his thin gray locks, that were discomposed in the paroxysm by his own
      hands, stood out in disorder upon his head. We question, indeed, whether
      mere imagination could, without having actually witnessed it in real life,
      conceive any object so frightfully illustrative of the terrible dominion
      which the passion of avarice is capable of exercising over the human
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I protest to Heaven,&rdquo; exclaimed the attorney, alarmed, &ldquo;I believe the man
      is dying&mdash;if not dead, he is motionless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O&rsquo;Donovan, what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s lips gave a dry, hard smack, then became desperately
      compressed together, and his cheeks were drawn still further into his
      jaws. At length he sighed deeply, and changed his fixed and motionless
      attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is alive, at all events,&rdquo; said one of his young men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fardorougha turned his eyes upon the speaker, then upon his master, and
      successively upon two other assistants who were in the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what is this?&mdash;I&rsquo;m very weak&mdash;will you
      get me a dhrink o&rsquo; wather? God help me&mdash;God direct me! I&rsquo;m an unhappy
      man; get me a dhrink, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake! I can hardly spake, my mouth and
      lips are so dry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The water having been procured, he drank it eagerly, and felt evidently
      relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This business,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;about the money&mdash;I mane about my poor
      boy. Connor, how will it be managed, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already told you that there is but one way of managing it, and
      that is, as the young man&rsquo;s life is at stake, to spare no cost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I must do that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought, at least, remember that he&rsquo;s an only son, and that if you lose
      him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lose him!&mdash;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;I&rsquo;d die&mdash;die&mdash;dead&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And by so shameful a death,&rdquo; proceeded Cassidy, &ldquo;you will not only be
      childless, but you will have the bitter fact to reflect on that he died in
      disgrace. You will blush to name him! What father would not make any
      sacrifice to prevent his child from meeting such a fate? It&rsquo;s a trying
      thing and a pitiable calamity to see a father ashamed to name the child
      that he loves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man arose, and, approaching Cassidy, said, eagerly, &ldquo;How much will
      do? Ashamed to name you, alanna, Ghierna&mdash;Ghierna&mdash;ashamed to
      name you, Connor! Oh! if the world knew you, as thore, as well as I an&rsquo; 
      your poor mother knows you, they&rsquo;d say that we ought to be proud to hear
      your name soundin&rsquo; in our ears. How much will do? for, may God stringthen
      me, I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think about forty guineas; it may be more, and it may be less, but we
      will say forty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll give you an ordher for it on a man that&rsquo;s a good mark. Give me
      pin an&rsquo; paper, fast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The paper was placed before him, and he held the pen in his hand for some
      time, and, ere he wrote, turned a look of deep distress on Cassidy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God Almighty pity me!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;you see&mdash;you see that I&rsquo;m a poor
      heart&mdash;broken creature&mdash;a ruined man I&rsquo;ll be&mdash;a ruined
      man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of your son, and of his situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s before me&mdash;I know it is&mdash;to die like a dog behind a ditch
      wid hunger!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of your son, I say, and, if possible, save him from a shameful
      death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Ay&mdash;yis&mdash;yis&mdash;surely&mdash;surely&mdash;oh, my poor
      boy&mdash;my innocent boy&mdash;I will&mdash;I will do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then sat down, and, with a tremulous hand, and lips tightly drawn
      together, wrote an order on P&mdash;&mdash;, the county treasurer, for the
      money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cassidy, on seeing it, looked alternately at the paper and the man for a
      considerable time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is P&mdash;&mdash;your banker?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every penny that I&rsquo;m worth he has.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re a ruined man,&rdquo; he replied, with cool emphasis. &ldquo;P&mdash;&mdash;
      absconded the day before yesterday, and robbed half the county. Have you
      no loose cash at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robbed! who robbed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, P&mdash;&mdash;has robbed every man who was fool enough to trust
      him; he&rsquo;s off to the Isle of Man, with the county funds in addition to the
      other prog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mane to say,&rdquo; replied Fardorougha, with a hideous calmness of
      voice and manner; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t, you can&rsquo;t mane to say he has run off wid my
      money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do; you&rsquo;ll never see a shilling of it, if you live to the age of a
      Hebrew patriarch. See what it is to fix the heart upon money. You are now,
      what you wish the world to believe you to be, a poor man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho! ho!&rdquo; howled the miser, &ldquo;he darn&rsquo;t, he darn&rsquo;t&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t God
      consume him if he robbed the poor&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t God stiffen him, and pin
      him to the airth, if he attempted to run off wid the hard earnings of
      strugglin&rsquo; honest men? Where &lsquo;ud God be, an&rsquo; him to dar to do it! But it&rsquo;s
      a falsity, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;re thryin&rsquo; me to see how I&rsquo;d bear it&mdash;it is, it
      is, an&rsquo; may Heaven forgive you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as true as the Gospel,&rdquo; replied the other; &ldquo;why, I&rsquo;m surprised you
      didn&rsquo;t hear it before now&mdash;every one knows it&mdash;it&rsquo;s over the
      whole country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie&mdash;it&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo; he howled again; &ldquo;no one dar to do such an
      act. You have some schame in this&mdash;you&rsquo;re not a safe man; you&rsquo;re a
      villain, an&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; else; but I&rsquo;ll soon know; which of these is my hat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mad, I think,&rdquo; said Cassidy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get me my hat, I say; I&rsquo;ll soon know it; but sure the world&rsquo;s all in a
      schame against me&mdash;all, all, young an&rsquo; ould&mdash;where&rsquo;s my hat, I
      say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have put it upon your head this moment,&rdquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; my stick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in your hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The curse o&rsquo; Heaven upon you,&rdquo; he shrieked, &ldquo;whether it&rsquo;s thrue or
      false!&rdquo; and, with a look that might scorch him to whom it was directed, he
      shuffled in a wild and frantic mood out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man is mad,&rdquo; observed Cassidy; &ldquo;or, if not, he will soon be so; I
      never witnessed such a desperate case of avarice. If ever the demon of
      money lurked in any man&rsquo;s soul, it&rsquo;s in his. God bless me! God bless me!
      it&rsquo;s dreadful! Richard, tell the gentleman in the dining-room I&rsquo;m at
      leisure to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The scene we have attempted to describe spared O&rsquo;Brien the trouble of much
      unpleasant inquiry, and enabled him to enter at once into the proposed
      arrangements on behalf of Connor. Of course he did not permit his sister&rsquo;s
      name to transpire, nor any trace whatsoever to appear, by which her
      delicacy might be compromised, or her character involved. His interference
      in the matter he judiciously put upon the footing of personal regard for
      the young man, and his reluctance to be even the indirect means of
      bringing him to a violent and shameful death. Having thus fulfilled Una&rsquo;s
      instructions, he returned home, and relieved her of a heavy burthen by a
      full communication of all that had been done.
    </p>
    <p>
      The struggle hitherto endured by Fardoroug&mdash;he was in its own nature
      sufficiently severe to render his sufferings sharp and pungent; still they
      resembled the influence of local disease more than that of a malady which
      prostrates the strength and grapples with the powers of the whole
      constitution. The sensation he immediately felt, on hearing that his
      banker had absconded with the gains of his penurious life, was rather a
      stunning shock that occasioned for the moment a feeling of dull, and
      heavy, and overwhelming dismay. It filled, nay, it actually distended his
      narrow soul with an oppressive sense of exclusive misery that banished all
      consideration for every person and thing extraneous to his individual
      selfishness. In truth, the tumult of his mind was peculiarly wild and
      anomalous. The situation of his son, and the dreadful fate that hung over
      him, were as completely forgotten as if they did not exist. Yet there lay,
      underneath his own gloomy agony, a remote consciousness of collateral
      affliction, such as is frequently experienced by those who may be drawn,
      by some temporary and present pleasure, from the contemplation of their
      misery. We feel, in such cases, that the darkness is upon us, even while
      the image of the calamity is not before the mind; nay, it sometimes
      requires an effort to bring it back, when anxious to account for our
      depression; but when it comes, the heart sinks with a shudder, and we
      feel, that, although it ceased to engage our thoughts, we had been sitting
      all the time beneath its shadow. For this reason, although Fardorougha&rsquo;s
      own loss absorbed, in one sense, all his powers of suffering, still he
      knew that something else pressed with additional weight upon his heart. Of
      its distinct character, however, he was ignorant, and only felt that a
      dead and heavy load of multiplied affliction bent him in burning anguish
      to the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is something more or less eccentric in the gait and dress of every
      miser. Fardorougha&rsquo;s pace was naturally slow, and the habit for which, in
      the latter point, he had all his life been remarkable, was that of wearing
      a great-coat thrown loosely about his shoulders. In summer it saved an
      inside one, and, as he said, kept him cool and comfortable. That he seldom
      or never put his arms into it arose from the fact that he knew it would
      last a much longer period of time than if he wore it in the usual manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      On leaving the attorney&rsquo;s office, he might be seen creeping along towards
      the County Treasurer&rsquo;s, at a pace quite unusual to him; his hollow,
      gleaming eyes were bent on the earth; his Gothamore about his shoulders;
      his staff held with a tight desperate grip, and his whole appearance that
      of a man frightfully distracted by the intelligence of some sudden
      calamity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not proceeded far on this hopeless errand, when many bitter
      confirmations of the melancholy truth, by persons whom he met on their
      return from P&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s residence, were afforded him. Even these,
      however, were insufficient to satisfy him; he heard them with a vehement
      impatience, that could not brook the bare possibility of the report being
      true. His soul clung with the tenacity of a death&mdash;grip to the hope,
      that however others might have suffered, some chance might,
      notwithstanding, still remain in Ms particular favor. In the meantime, he
      poured out curses of unexampled malignity against the guilty defaulter, on
      whose head he invoked the Almighty&rsquo;s vengeance with a venomous fervor
      which appalled all who heard him. Having reached the treasurer&rsquo;s house, a
      scene presented itself that was by no means calculated to afford him
      consolation. Persons of every condition, from the squireen and gentleman
      farmer, to the humble widow and inexperienced orphan, stood in melancholy
      groups about the deserted mansion, interchanging details of their losses,
      their blasted prospects, and their immediate ruin. The cries of the widow,
      who mourned for the desolation brought upon her and her now destitute
      orphans, rose in a piteous wail to heaven, and the industrious fathers of
      many struggling families, with pale faces and breaking hearts, looked in
      silent misery upon the closed shutters and smokeless chimneys of their
      oppressor&rsquo;s house, bitterly conscious that the laws of the boasted
      constitution under which they lived, permitted the destroyer of hundreds
      to enjoy, in luxury and security, the many thousands of which, at one fell
      and rapacious swoop, he had deprived them.
    </p>
    <p>
      With white, quivering lips and panting breath, Fardorougha approached and
      joined them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, what,&rdquo; said he, in a broken sentence, &ldquo;is this true&mdash;can it,
      can it be true? Is the thievin&rsquo; villain of hell gone? Has he robbed us,
      ruined us, destroyed us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, too thrue it is,&rdquo; replied a farmer; &ldquo;the dam&rsquo; rip is off to that nest
      of robbers, the Isle of Man; ay, he&rsquo;s gone! an&rsquo; may all our bad luck past,
      present, and to come, go with him, an&rsquo; all he tuck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fardorougha looked at his informant as if he had been P&mdash;&mdash;himself;
      he then glared from one to another, whilst the white foam wrought up to
      his lips by the prodigious force of his excitement. He clasped his hands,
      then attempted to speak, but language had abandoned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If one is to judge from your appearance, you have suffered heavily,&rdquo;
       observed the farmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other stared at him with a kind of angry amazement for doubting it, or
      it might be, for speaking so coolly of his loss. &ldquo;Suffered!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;ay,
      ay, but did yeea thry the house? we&rsquo;ll see&mdash;suffered!&mdash;suffered!&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
      see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He immediately shuffled over to the hall door, which he assaulted with the
      eagerness of a despairing soul at the gate of heaven, throwing into each
      knock such a character of impatience and apprehension, as one might
      suppose the aforesaid soul to feel from a certain knowledge that the
      devil&rsquo;s clutches were spread immediately behind, to seize and carry him to
      perdition. His impetuosity, however, was all in vain; not even an echo
      reverberated through the cold and empty walls, but, on the contrary, every
      peal was followed by a most unromantic and ominous silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That man appears beside himself,&rdquo; observed another of the sufferers;
      &ldquo;surely, it he wasn&rsquo;t half-mad, he&rsquo;d not expect to find any one in an
      empty house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Devil a much it signifies whether he&rsquo;s mad or otherwise,&rdquo; responded a
      neighbor. &ldquo;I know him well; his name&rsquo;s Fardorougha Donovan, the miser of
      Lisnamona, the biggest shkew that ever skinned a flint. If P&mdash;&mdash;did
      nothin&rsquo; worse than fleece him, it would never stand between him an&rsquo; the
      blessin&rsquo; o&rsquo; Heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0002" id="linkimage-0002">

    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">

    </div>
    <p>
      Fardorougha, in the mean time, finding that no response was given from the
      front, passed hurriedly by an archway into the back court, where he made
      similar efforts to get in by attempting to force the kitchen door. Every
      entrance, however, had been strongly secured; he rattled, and thumped, and
      screamed, as if P&mdash;&mdash;himself had actually been within hearing,
      but still to no purpose; he might as well have expected to extort a reply
      from the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he returned to the group that stood on the lawn, the deadly
      conviction that all was lost affected every joint of his body with a
      nervous trepidation, that might have been mistaken for <i>delirium tremens</i>.
      His eyes were full of terror, mingled with the impotent fury of hatred and
      revenge; whilst over all now predominated for the first time such an
      expression of horror and despair, as made the spectators shudder to look
      upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was God,&rdquo; said he, addressing them, and his voice, naturally thin
      and wiry, now became lmsky and hollow, &ldquo;where was God, to suffer this? to
      suffer the poor to be ruined, and the rich to be made poor? Was it right
      for the Almighty to look on an&rsquo; let the villain do it? No&mdash;no&mdash;no;
      I say no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The group around him shuddered at the daring blasphemy to which his
      monstrous passion had driven him. Many females, who were in tears,
      lamenting audibly, started, and felt their grief suspended for a moment by
      this revolting charge against the justice of Providence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you all stand for here,&rdquo; he proceeded, &ldquo;like stocks an stones?
      Why don&rsquo;t yees kneel with me, an&rsquo; let us join in one curse; one, no, but
      let us shower them down upon him in thousands&mdash;in millions; an&rsquo; when
      we can no longer spake them, let us think them. To the last hour of my
      life my heart &lsquo;ill never be widout a curse for him; an&rsquo; the last word
      afore I go into the presence of God, &lsquo;ll be a black, heavy blessin&rsquo; from
      hell against him an&rsquo; his, sowl an&rsquo; body, while a drop o&rsquo; their bad blood&rsquo;s
      upon the earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be blasphamin&rsquo;, honest man,&rdquo; said a bystander; &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ve lost
      money, that&rsquo;s no rason why you should fly in the face o&rsquo; God for P&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s
      roguery. Devil a one o&rsquo; myself cares if I join you in a volley against the
      robbin&rsquo; scoundril, but I&rsquo;d not take all the money the rip of hell ran away
      wid, an&rsquo; spake of God as you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Saver!&rdquo; exclaimed Fardorougha, who probably heard not a word he said;
      &ldquo;I knew&mdash;I knew&mdash;I always felt it was before me&mdash;a dog&rsquo;s
      death behind a ditch&mdash;my tongue out wid starvation and hunger, and it
      was he brought me to it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had already knelt, and was uncovered, his whitish hair tossed by the
      breeze in confusion about a face on which was painted the fearful workings
      of that giant spirit, under whose tremendous grasp he writhed and suffered
      like a serpent in the talons of a vulture. In this position, with uplifted
      and trembling arms, his face raised towards heaven, and his whole figure
      shrunk firmly together by the intense malignity with which he was about to
      hiss out his venomous imprecations against the defaulter, he presented at
      least one instance in which the low, sordid vice of avarice rose to
      something like wild grandeur, if not sublimity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having remained in this posture for some time, he clasped his withered
      hands together and wrung them until the bones cracked; then rising up and
      striking his stick bitterly upon the earth&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get out the curses against him; but my
      heart&rsquo;s full of them&mdash;they&rsquo;re in it&mdash;they&rsquo;re in it!&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      black an&rsquo; hot wid them; I feel them here&mdash;here&mdash;movin an if they
      war alive, an&rsquo; they&rsquo;ll be out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such was the strength and impetuosity of his hatred, and such his
      eagerness to discharge the whole quiver of his maledictions against the
      great public delinquent, that, as often happens in cases of overwhelming
      agitation, his faculties were paralyzed by the storm of passion which
      raged within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having risen to his feet, he left the group, muttering his wordless
      malignity as he went along, and occasionally pausing to look back with the
      fiery glare of a hyena at the house in which the robbery of his soul&rsquo;s
      treasure had been planned and accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is unnecessary to say that the arrangements entered into with Cassidy,
      by John O&rsquo;Brien, were promptly and ably carried into effect. A rapid ride
      soon brought the man of briefs and depositions to the prison, where the
      unhappy Connor lay. The young man&rsquo;s story, though simple, was improbable,
      and his version of the burning such as induced Cassidy, who knew little of
      impressions and feelings in the absence of facts, to believe that no other
      head than his ever concocted the crime. Still, from the manly sincerity
      with which his young client spoke, he felt inclined to impute the act to a
      freak of boyish malice and disappointment, rather than to a spirit of
      vindictive rancor. He entertained no expectation whatsoever of Connor&rsquo;s
      acquittal, and hinted to him that it was his habit in such cases to
      recommend his clients to be prepared for the worst, without, at the same
      time, altogether abolishing hope. There was, indeed, nothing to break the
      chain of circumstantial evidence in which Flanagan had entangled him; he
      had been at the haggard shortly before the conflagration broke out; he had
      met Phil Curtis, and begged that man to conceal the fact of his having
      seen him, and he had not slept in his own bed either on that or the
      preceding night. It was to no purpose he affirmed that Flanagan himself
      had borrowed from him, and worn, on the night in question, the shoes whose
      prints were so strongly against him, or that the steel and tinder&mdash;box,
      which were found in his pocket, actually belonged to his accuser, who must
      have put them there without his knowledge. His case, in fact, was a bad
      one, and he felt that the interview with his attorney left him more
      seriously impressed with the danger of his situation, than he had been up
      till that period.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said he, when the instructions were completed, &ldquo;you have seen
      my father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything is fully and liberally arranged,&rdquo; replied the other, with
      reservation; &ldquo;your father has been with me to&mdash;day; in fact, I parted
      with him only a few minutes before I left home. So far let your mind be
      easy. The government prosecutes, which is something in your favor; and
      now, good-by to you; for my part, I neither advise you to hope or despair.
      If the worst comes to the worst, you must bear it like a man; and if we
      get an acquittal, it will prove the more agreeable for its not being
      expected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The unfortunate youth felt, after Cassidy&rsquo;s departure, the full force of
      that dark and fearful presentiment which arises from the approach of the
      mightiest calamity that can befall an innocent man&mdash;a public and
      ignominious death, while in the very pride of youth, strength, and those
      natural hopes of happiness which existence had otherwise promised. In him
      this awful apprehension proceeded neither from the terror of judgment nor
      of hell, but from that dread of being withdrawn from life, and of passing
      down from the light, the enjoyments and busy intercourse of a breathing
      and conscious world, into the silence and corruption of the unknown grave.
      When this ghastly picture was brought near him by the force of his
      imagination, he felt for a moment as if his heart had died away in him,
      and his blood became congealed into ice. Should this continue, he knew
      that human nature could not sustain it long, and he had already resolved
      to bear his fate with firmness, whatever that fate might be. He then
      reflected that he was innocent, and, remembering the practice of his
      simple and less political forefathers, he knelt down and fervently
      besought the protection of that, Being in whose hands are the issues of
      life and death.
    </p>
    <p>
      On rising from this act of heartfelt devotion, he experienced that support
      which he required so much. The fear of death ceased to alarm him, and his
      natural fortitude returned with more than its usual power to his support.
      In this state of mind he was pacing his narrow room, when the door opened,
      and his father, with a tottering step, entered and approached him. The son
      was startled, if not terrified, at the change which so short a time had
      wrought in the old man&rsquo;s appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God, father dear!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as the latter threw his arms with a
      tight and clinging grasp about him; &ldquo;good heavens! what has happened to
      change you so much for the worse? Why, if you fret this way about me,
      you&rsquo;ll soon break your heart. Why will you fret, father, when you know I
      am innocent? Surely, at the worst, it is better to die innocent than to
      live guilty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor,&rdquo; said the old man, still clinging tenaciously to him, and looking
      wildly into his face, &ldquo;Connor, it&rsquo;s broke&mdash;my heart&rsquo;s broke at last.
      Oh, Connor, won&rsquo;t you pity me when you hear it&mdash;won&rsquo;t you, Connor&mdash;oh,
      when you hear it, Connor, won&rsquo;t you pity me? It&rsquo;s gone, it&rsquo;s gone, it&rsquo;s
      gone&mdash;he&rsquo;s off, off&mdash;to that nest of robbers, the Isle of Man,
      and has robbed me and half the county. P&mdash;&mdash;has; I&rsquo;m a ruined
      man, a beggar, an&rsquo; will die a dog&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connor looked down keenly into his father&rsquo;s face, and began to entertain a
      surmise so terrible that the beatings of his heart were in a moment
      audible to his own ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; he inquired, &ldquo;in the name of God what is wrong with you? What is
      it you spake of? Has P&mdash;&mdash;gone off with your money? Sit down,
      and don&rsquo;t look so terrified.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has, Connor&mdash;robbed me an&rsquo; half the county&mdash;he disappeared
      the evenin&rsquo; of the very day I left my last lodgment wid him; he&rsquo;s in that
      nest of robbers, the Isle of Man, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m ruined&mdash;ruined! Oh God!
      Connor, how can I stand it? all my earnin&rsquo;s an&rsquo; my savin&rsquo;s an&rsquo; the fruits
      of my industry in his pocket, an&rsquo; upon his back, an&rsquo; upon his bones! My
      brain is reelin&rsquo;&mdash;I dunna what I&rsquo;m doin&rsquo;, nor what I&rsquo;ll do. To what
      hand now can I turn myself? Who&rsquo;ll assist me! I dunna what I&rsquo;m doin&rsquo;, nor
      scarcely what I&rsquo;m sayin&rsquo;. My head&rsquo;s all in confusion. Gone! gone! gone! Oh
      see the luck that has come down upon me! Above all men, why was I singled
      out to be made a world&rsquo;s wondher of&mdash;why was I? What did I do? I
      robbed no one; yet it&rsquo;s gone&mdash;an&rsquo; see the death that&rsquo;s afore me! oh
      God! oh God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, father, let it go&mdash;you have still your health; you have still
      my poor mother to console you; and I hope you&rsquo;ll soon have myself, too;
      between us well keep you comfortable, and, if you&rsquo;ll allow us to take our
      own way, more so than ever you did&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pardorougha started, as if struck by some faint but sudden recollection.
      All at once he looked with amazement around the room, and afterwards with
      a pause of inquiry, at his son. At length, a light of some forgotten
      memory appeared to flash at once across his brain; his countenance changed
      from the wild and unsettled expression which it bore, to one more stamped
      with the earnest humanity of our better nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Connor!&rdquo; he at last exclaimed, putting his two hands into those of
      his son: &ldquo;can you pity me, an&rsquo; forgive me? You see, my poor boy, how I&rsquo;m
      sufferin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; you see that I can&rsquo;t&mdash;I won&rsquo;t&mdash;be able to bear up
      against this long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tears here ran down his worn and hollow cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he proceeded, &ldquo;how could I forget you, my darlin&rsquo; boy? But I hardly
      think my head&rsquo;s right. If I had you with me, an&rsquo; before my eyes, you&rsquo;d
      keep my heart right, an&rsquo; give me strength, which I stand sorely in need
      of. Saints in glory! how could I forget you, acushla, an&rsquo; what now can I
      do for you? Not a penny have I to pay lawyer, or attorney, or any one, to
      defind you at your trial, and it so near!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, haven&rsquo;t you settled all that with Mr. Cassidy, the attorney?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit, achora machree, not a bit; I was wid him this day, an&rsquo; had
      agreed, but whin I wint to give him an ordher on P&mdash;&mdash;, he&mdash;oh
      saints above! he whistled at me an&rsquo; it&mdash;an&rsquo; tould me that P&mdash;&mdash;was
      gone to that nest o&rsquo; robbers, the Isle of Man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor,&rdquo; said he, feebly, &ldquo;I am unwell&mdash;unwell&mdash;come and sit
      down by me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too much distressed every way, father,&rdquo; said his son, taking his
      place upon his iron bedstead beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Fardorougha, calmly; &ldquo;I am too much distressed&mdash;sit
      nearer me, Connor. I wish your mother was here, but she wasn&rsquo;t able to
      come, she&rsquo;s unwell too; a good mother she was, Connor, and a good wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The son was struck, and somewhat alarmed, by this sudden and extraordinary
      calmness of the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father dear,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be too much disheartened&mdash;all will be
      well yet, I hope&mdash;my trust in God is strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope all will be well,&rdquo; replied the old man, &ldquo;sit nearer me, an&rsquo; 
      Connor, let me lay my head over upon your breast. I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; a great
      dale. Don&rsquo;t the world say, Connor, that I am a bad man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what the world says; no one in it ever durst say as much to
      me, father dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man looked up affectionately, but shook his head apparently in
      calm but rooted sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put your arms about me, Connor, and keep my head a little more up; I&rsquo;m
      weak an&rsquo; tired, an&rsquo;, someway, spakin&rsquo;s a throuble to me; let me think for
      a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do so, father,&rdquo; said the son, with deep compassion; &ldquo;God knows but you&rsquo;re
      sufferin&rsquo; enough to wear you out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Fardorougha, &ldquo;it is.&rdquo; A silence of some minutes ensued,
      during which, Connor perceived that the old man, overcome with care and
      misery, had actually! fallen asleep with his head upon his bosom. This
      circumstance, though by no means extraordinary, affected him very much. On
      surveying the pallid face of his father, and the worn, thread&mdash;like
      veins that ran along his temples, and calling to mind the love of the old
      man for himself, which even avarice, in its deadliest power, failed to
      utterly overcome, he felt all the springs of his affection loosened, and
      his soul vibrated with a tenderness towards him, such as no situation in
      their past lives had ever before created.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my fate chances to be an untimely one, father dear,&rdquo; he slowly
      murmured, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll soon meet in another place; for I know that you will not
      long live after me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then thought with bitterness of his mother and Una, and wondered at the
      mystery of the trial to which he was exposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s slumber, however, was not dreamless, nor so refreshing as
      the exhaustion of a frame shattered by the havoc of contending principles
      required. On the contrary, it was disturbed by heavy groans, quick
      startings, and those twitchings of the limbs which betoken a restless mood
      of mind, and a nervous system highly excited. In the course of half an
      hour, the symptoms of his inward commotion became more apparent. From
      being, as at first, merely physical, they assumed a mental character, anil
      passed from ejaculations and single words, to short sentences, and
      ultimately to those of considerable length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;gone! Oh God my curse&mdash;starved&mdash;dog&mdash;wid
      my tongue out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This dread of starvation, which haunted him through life, appeared in his
      dream still to follow him like a demon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dyin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dyin&rsquo; wid hunger&mdash;will no one give me a
      morsel? I was robbed an&rsquo; have no money&mdash;don&rsquo;t you see me starvin&rsquo;?
      I&rsquo;m cuttin&rsquo; wid hunger&mdash;five days without mate&mdash;bring me mate,
      for God&rsquo;s sake&mdash;mate, mate, mate!&mdash;I&rsquo;m gaspin&mdash;my tongue&rsquo;s
      out; look at me, like a dog, behind this ditch, an&rsquo; my tongue out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The son at this period would have awoke him, but he became more composed,
      for a time, and enjoyed apparently a refreshing sleep. Still, it soon was
      evident that he dreamt, and as clear that a change had come o&rsquo;er the
      spirit of his dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;ll prevent me!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he my son&mdash;our only child?
      Let me alone&mdash;I must, I must&mdash;what&rsquo;s my life?&mdash;take it, an&rsquo; 
      let him live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tears started in Connor&rsquo;s eyes, and he pressed his father to his
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hould me,&rdquo; he proceeded. &ldquo;O God! here, I&rsquo;ll give all I&rsquo;m worth, an&rsquo; 
      save him! O, let me, thin&mdash;let me but kiss him once before he dies;
      it was I, it was myself that murdhered him&mdash;all might &lsquo;a been well;
      ay, it was I that murdhered you, Connor, my brave hoy, an&rsquo; have I you in
      my arms? O, aviek agus asthore machree, it was I that murdhered you, by my&mdash;but
      they&rsquo;re takin&rsquo; him&mdash;they&rsquo;re bearin&rsquo; him away to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He started, and awoke; but so terrific had been his dream, that on opening
      his eyes he clasped Connor in his arms, and exclaimed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No no, I&rsquo;ll hould him till you cut my grip; Connor, avick machree, hould
      to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, father, for God&rsquo;s sake, think a minute, you wor only dreaming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh&mdash;what&mdash;where am I? Oh, Connor, darling, if you knew the
      dhrames I had&mdash;I thought you wor on the scaffie; but thanks be to the
      Saver, it was only a dhrame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing more, father, nothing more; but for God&rsquo;s sake, keep your mind
      aisy. Trust in God, father, everything&rsquo;s in <i>His</i> hands; if; it&rsquo;s His
      will to make us suffer, we ought to submit; and if it&rsquo;s not His will, He
      surely can bring us out of all our throubles. That&rsquo;s the greatest comfort
      I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fardorougha once more became calm, but still there was on his countenance,
      which was mournful and full of something else than simple sorrow, some
      deeply fixed determination, such as it was difficult to develop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor, achora,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I must lave you, for there&rsquo;s little time to be
      lost. What attorney would you wish me to employ? I&rsquo;ll go home and sell
      oats and a cow or two. I&rsquo;ve done you harm enough&mdash;more than you know&mdash;but
      now I&rsquo;ll spare no cost to get you out of this business. Connor, the tears
      that I saw awhile agone run down your cheeks cut me to the heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The son then informed him that a friend had taken proper measures for his
      defence, and that any further interference on his part would only create
      confusion and delay. He also entreated his father to make no allusion
      whatsoever to this circumstance, and added, &ldquo;that he himself actually knew
      not the name of the friend in question, but that, as the matter stood, he
      considered even a surmise to be a breach of confidence that might be
      indelicate and offensive. After the trial, you can and ought to pay the
      expenses, and not be under an obligation to any one of so solemn a kind as
      that.&rdquo; He then sent his affectionate love and duty to his mother, at whose
      name his eyes were again filled with tears, and begged the old man to
      comfort and support her with the utmost care and tenderness. As she was
      unwell, he requested him to dissuade her against visiting him till after
      the trial, lest an interview might increase her illness, and render her
      less capable of bearing up under an unfavorable sentence, should such be
      the issue of the prosecution. Having then bade farewell to, and embraced
      the old man, the latter departed with more calmness and fortitude than he
      had up to that period displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Time approaches the miserable with calamity in his train, his opinion
      is swifter than that of the eagle; but, alas! when carrying them towards
      happiness, his pace is slower than is that of the tortoise. The only three
      persons on earth, whose happiness was involved in that of O&rsquo;Donovan, found
      themselves, on the eve of the assizes, overshadowed by a dreariness of
      heart, that was strong in proportion to the love they bore him. The dead
      calm which had fallen on Fardorougha was absolutely more painful to his
      wife than would have been the paroxysms that resulted from his lust of
      wealth. Since his last interview with Connor, he never once alluded to the
      loss of his money, unless abruptly in his dreams, but there was stamped
      upon his whole manner a gloomy and mysterious composure, which, of itself,
      wofully sank her spirits, independently of the fate which impended over
      their son. The change, visible on both, and the breaking down of their
      strength were indeed pitiable.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Una, it would be difficult to describe her struggle between
      confidence in his innocence, and apprehension of the law, which she knew
      had often punished the guiltless instead of the criminal. &lsquo;Tis true she
      attempted to assume, in the eyes of others, a fortitude which belied her
      fears, and even affected to smile at the possibility of her lover&rsquo;s honor
      and character suffering any tarnish from the ordeal to which they were
      about to be submitted. Her smile, however, on such occasions, was a
      melancholy one, and the secret tears she shed might prove, as they did to
      her brother, who was alone privy to her grief, the extent of those terrors
      which, notwithstanding her disavowal of them, wrung her soul so bitterly.
      Day after day her spirits became more and more depressed, till, as the
      crisis of Connor&rsquo;s fate arrived, the roses had altogether flown from her
      cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, now that the trial was at hand, public sympathy turned rapidly and
      strongly in his favor; his father had lost that wealth, the acquisition of
      which earned him so heavy a portion of infamy; and, as he had been
      sufficiently punished in his own person, they did not think it just to
      transfer any portion of the resentment borne against him to a son who had
      never participated in his system of oppression. They felt for Connor now
      on his own account, and remembered only his amiable and excellent
      character. In addition to this, the history of the mutual attachment
      between him and Una having become the topic of general conversation, the
      rash act for which he stood committed was good-humoredly resolved into a
      foolish freak of love; for which it would be a thousand murders to take
      away his life. In such mood were the public and the parties most
      interested in the event of our story, when the morning dawned of that
      awful day which was to restore Connor O&rsquo;Donovan to the hearts that loved
      him so well, or to doom him, a convicted felon, to a shameful and
      ignominious death.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the trial came on, and our unhappy prisoner, at the hour of
      eleven o&rsquo;clock, was placed at the bar of his country to stand the brunt of
      a government prosecution. Common report had already carried abroad the
      story of Una&rsquo;s love and his, many interesting accounts of which had got
      into the papers of the day. When he stood forward, therefore, all eyes
      were eagerly riveted upon him; the judge glanced at him with calm,
      dispassionate scrutiny, and the members of the bax, especially the
      juniors, turned round, surveyed him through their glasses with a gaze in
      which might be read something more than that hard indifference which
      familiarity with human crime and affliction ultimately produces even in
      dispositions most human and amiable. No sooner had the curiosity of the
      multitude been gratified, than a murmur of pity, blended slightly with
      surprise and approbation, ran lowly through the court-house. One of the
      judges whispered a few words to his brother, and the latter again surveyed
      Connor with a countenance in which were depicted admiration and regret.
      The counsel also chatted to each other in a low tone, occasionally turning
      round and marking his deportment and appearance with increasing interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seldom, probably never, had a more striking, perhaps a more noble figure,
      stood at the bar of that court. His locks were rich and brown; his
      forehead expansive, and his manly features remarkable for their symmetry;
      his teeth were regular and white, and his dark eye full of a youthful
      lustre, which the dread of no calamity could repress. Neither was his
      figure, which was of the tallest, inferior in a single point to so fine a
      countenance. As he stood, at his full height of six feet, it was
      impossible not to feel deeply influenced in his favor, especially after
      having witnessed the mournful but dignified composure of his manner,
      equally remote from indifference or dejection. He appeared, indeed, to
      view in its proper light the danger of the position in which he stood, but
      he viewed it with the calm, unshrinking energy of a brave man who is
      always prepared for the worst. Indeed, there might be observed upon his
      broad, open brow a loftiness of bearing such as is not unfrequently
      produced by a consciousness of innocence, and the natural elevation of
      mind which results from a sense of danger; to which we may add that inward
      scorn which is ever felt for baseness, by those who are degraded to the
      necessity of defending themselves against the villany of the malignant and
      profligate.
    </p>
    <p>
      When called upon to plead to the indictment, he uttered the words &ldquo;not
      guilty&rdquo; in a full, firm and mellow voice, that drew the eyes of the
      spectators once more upon him, and occasioned another slight hum of
      sympathy and admiration. No change of color was observable on his
      countenance, or any other expression, save the lofty composure to which we
      have just alluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trial at length proceeded; and, after a long and able statement from
      the Attorney-General, Bartle Flanagan was called up on the table. The
      prisoner, whose motions were keenly observed, betrayed, on seeing him,
      neither embarrassment nor agitation; all that could be perceived was a
      more earnest and intense light in his eyes, as they settled upon his
      accuser. Flanagan detailed, with singular minuteness and accuracy, the
      whole progress of the crime from its first conception to its perpetration.
      Indeed, had he himself been in the dock, and his evidence against Connor a
      confession of his own guilt, it would, with some exceptions, have been
      literally true. He was ably cross-examined, but no tact, or experience, or
      talent, on the part of the prisoner&rsquo;s counsel, could, in any important
      degree, shake his testimony. The ingenuity with which he laid and
      conducted the plot was astonishing, as was his foresight, and the
      precaution he adopted against detection. Cassidy, Connor&rsquo;s attorney, had
      ferreted out the very man from whom he purchased the tinder-box, with a
      hope of proving that it was not the prisoner&rsquo;s property but his own; yet
      this person, who remembered the transaction very well, assured him that
      Flanagan said he procured it by the desire of Fardorougha Donovan&rsquo;s son.
    </p>
    <p>
      During his whole evidence, he never once raised his eye to look upon the
      prisoner&rsquo;s face, until he was desired to identify him. He then turned
      round, and, standing with the rod in his hand, looked for some moments
      upon his victim. His dark brows got black as night, whilst his cheeks were
      blanched to the hue of ashes&mdash;the white smile as before sat upon his
      lips, and his eyes, in which there blazed the unsteady fire of a
      treacherous and cowardly heart, sparkled with the red turbid glare of
      triumph and vengeance. He laid the rod upon Connor&rsquo;s head, and they gazed
      at each other face to face, exhibiting as striking a contrast as could be
      witnessed. The latter stood erect and unshaken&mdash;his eye calmly bent
      upon that of his foe, but with a spirit in it that seemed to him alone by
      whom it was best understood, to strike dismay into the very soul of
      falsehood within him. The villain&rsquo;s eyes could not withstand the glance of
      Connor&rsquo;s&mdash;they fell, and his whole countenance assumed such a blank
      and guilty stamp, that an old experienced barrister, who watched them
      both, could not avoid saying, that if he had his will they should exchange
      situations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not hang a dog,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;on that fellow&rsquo;s evidence&mdash;he
      has guilt in his face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When asked why he ran away on meeting Phil. Curtis, near O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s house,
      on their return that night, while Connor held his ground, he replied that
      it was very natural he should run away, and not wish to be seen after
      having assisted at such a crime. In reply to another question, he said it
      was as natural that Connor should have ran away also, and that he could
      not account for it, except by the fact that God always occasions the
      guilty to commit some oversight, by which they may be brought to
      punishment. These replies, apparently so rational and satisfactory,
      convinced Connor&rsquo;s counsel that his case was hopeless, and that no skill
      or ingenuity on their part could succeed in breaking down Flanagan&rsquo;s
      evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next witness called was Phil. Curtis, whose testimony corroborated
      Bartle&rsquo;s in every particular, and gave to the whole trial a character of
      gloom and despair. The constables who applied his shoes to the footmarks
      were then produced, and swore in the clearest manner as to their
      corresponding. They then deposed to finding the tinder-box in his pocket,
      according to the information received from Flanagan, every tittle of which
      they found to be remarkably correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was only one other witness now necessary to complete the chain
      against him, and he was only produced because Biddy Nulty, the servant&mdash;maid,
      positively stated, and actually swore, when previously examined, that she
      was ignorant whether Connor slept in his father&rsquo;s house on the night in
      question or not. There was no alternative, therefore, but to produce the
      father; and Fardorougha Donovan was consequently forced to become an
      evidence against his own son.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s appearance upon the table excited deep commiseration for
      both, and the more so when the spectators contemplated the rooted sorrow
      which lay upon the wild and wasted features of the woe-worn father. Still
      the old man was composed and calm; but his calmness was in an
      extraordinary degree mournful and touching. &ldquo;When he, sat down, after
      having been sworn, and feebly wiped the dew from his thin temples, many
      eyes were already filled with tears. When the question was put to him if
      he remembered the night laid in the indictment, he replied that he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the prisoner at the bar sleep at home on that night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man looked into the face of the counsel with such an eye of
      deprecating entreaty, as shook the voice in which the question was
      repeated. He then turned about, and, taking a long gaze at his son, rose
      up, and, extending his hands to the judges, exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lords, my lords! he is my only son&mdash;my only child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words were followed by a pause in the business of the court, and a
      dead silence of more than a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If justice,&rdquo; said the judge, &ldquo;could on an occasion waive her claim to a
      subordinate link in the testimony she requires, it would certainly be in a
      case so painful and affecting as this. Still, we cannot permit personal
      feeling, however amiable, or domestic attachment, however strong, to
      impede her progress when redressing public wrong. Although the duty be
      painful, and we admit that such a duty is one of unexampled agony, yet it
      must be complied with; and you consequently will answer the question which
      the counsel has put to you. The interests of society require such
      sacrifices, and they must be made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man kept his eyes fixed on the judge while he spoke, but when he
      had ceased he again fixed them on his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; he exclaimed again, with clasped hands, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing criminal, or improper, or sinful in it,&rdquo; replied the
      judge; &ldquo;on the contrary, it is your duty, both as a Christian and a man.
      Remember, you have this moment sworn to tell the truth, and the whole
      truth; you consequently must keep your oath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you say, sir, may be right, an&rsquo; of coorse is; but oh, my lord, I&rsquo;m
      not able; I can&rsquo;t get out the words to hang my only boy. If I said
      anything to hurt him, my heart &lsquo;ud break before your eyes. May be you
      don&rsquo;t know the love of a father for an only son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps, my lords,&rdquo; observed the attorney-general, &ldquo;it would be desirable
      to send for a clergyman of his own religion, who might succeed in
      prevailing on him to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; interrupted Fardorougha; &ldquo;my mind&rsquo;s made up; a word against him will
      never come from my lips, not for priest or friar. I&rsquo;d die widout the
      saykerment sooner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is trifling with the court,&rdquo; said the judge, assuming an air of
      severity, which, however, he did not feel. &ldquo;We shall be forced to commit
      you to prison unless you give evidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said Fardorougha, meekly, but firmly, &ldquo;I am willin&rsquo; to go to
      prison&mdash;I am willin&rsquo; to die with him, if he is to die, but I neither
      can nor will open my lips against him. If I thought him guilty I might;
      but I know he is innocent&mdash;my heart knows it; an&rsquo; am I to back the
      villain that&rsquo;s strivin&rsquo; to swear his life away? No, Connor avourneen,
      whatever they do to you, your father will have no hand in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The court, in fact, were perplexed in the extreme. The old man was not
      only firm, from motives of strong attachment, but intractable from an
      habitual narrowness of thought, which prevented him from taking that
      comprehensive view of justice and judicial authority which might overcome
      the repugnance of men less obstinate from ignorance of legal usages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask you for the last time,&rdquo; said the judge, &ldquo;will you give your
      evidence? because, if you refuse, the court will feel bound to send you to
      prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you, my lord! that&rsquo;s a relief to my heart. Anything, anything,
      but to say a word against a boy that, since the day he was born, never
      vexed either his mother or myself. If he gets over this, I have much to
      make up to him; for, indeed, I wasn&rsquo;t the father to him that I ought.
      Avick machree, now I feel it, may be whin it&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words affected all who heard them, many even to tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no remedy,&rdquo; observed the judge. &ldquo;Tipstaff, take away the witness
      to prison. It is painful to me,&rdquo; he added, in a broken voice, &ldquo;to feel
      compelled thus to punish you for an act which, however I may respect the
      motives that dictate it, I cannot overlook. The ends of justice cannot be
      frustrated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mylord,&rdquo; exclaimed the prisoner, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t punish the old man for refusing
      to speak against me. His love for me is so strong that I know he couldn&rsquo;t
      do it. I will state the truth myself, but spare him. I did not sleep in my
      own bed on the night Mr. O&rsquo; Brien&rsquo;s haggard was burned, nor on the night
      before it. I slept in my father&rsquo;s barn, with Flanagan; both times at his
      own request but I did not then suspect his design in asking me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This admission, though creditable to your affection and filial duty, was
      indiscreet,&rdquo; observed the judge. &ldquo;Whatever you think might be serviceable,
      suggest to your attorney, who can communicate it to your counsel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said Connor, &ldquo;I could not see my father punished for loving me
      as he does an&rsquo; besides I have no wish to conceal anything. If the whole
      truth could be known I would stand but a short time where I an nor would
      Flanagan be long out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There is an earnest and impressive tone in truth, especially when spoken
      under circumstances of great difficulty, where it is rather
      disadvantageous to him who utters it, that in many instances produces
      conviction by an inherent candor which all feel, without as process of
      reasoning or argument. Theis was in those few words a warmth of affection
      towards his father, and a manly simplicity heart, each of which was duly
      appreciated by the assembly about him, who felt, without knowing why, the
      indignant scorn of falsehood that so emphatically pervaded his
      expressions. It was indeed impossible to hear them, and look upon his
      noble countenance and figure, without forgetting the humbleness of his
      rank in life, and feeling for him a marked deference and respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trial then proceeded; but, alas! the hopes of Connor&rsquo;s friends
      abandoned them at its conclusion; for although the judge&rsquo;s charge was as
      favorable as the nature of the evidence permitted, yet it was quite clear
      that the jury had only one course to pursue, and that was to bring in a
      conviction. After the lapse of about ten minutes, they returned to the
      jury&mdash;box, and, as the foreman handed down their verdict, a feather
      might have been heard falling in the court. The faces of the spectators
      got pale, and the hearts of strong men beat as if the verdict about to be
      announced were to fall upon themselves, and not upon the prisoner. It is
      at all times an awful and trying ceremony to witness, but on this occasion
      it was a much more affecting one than had occurred in that court for many
      years. As the foreman handed down the verdict, Connor&rsquo;s eye followed the
      paper with the same calm resolution which he displayed during the trial.
      On himself there was no change visible, unless the appearance of two round
      spots, one on each cheek, of a somewhat deeper red than the rest. At
      length, in the midst of the dead silence, pronounced in a voice that
      reached to the remotest extremity of the court, was heard the fatal
      sentence&mdash;&ldquo;Guilty;&rdquo; and afterwards, in a less distinct manner&mdash;&ldquo;with
      our strongest and most earnest recommendation for mercy, in consequence of
      his youth and previous good character.&rdquo; The wail and loud sobbings of the
      female part of the crowd, and the stronger but more silent grief of the
      men, could not, for many minutes, be repressed by any efforts of the court
      or its officers. In the midst of this, a little to the left of the dock,
      was an old man, whom those around him were conveying in a state of
      insensibility out of the court; and it was obvious that, from motives of
      humane consideration for the prisoner, they endeavored to prevent him from
      ascertaining that it was his father. In this, however, they failed; the
      son&rsquo;s eye caught a glimpse of his grey locks, and it was observed that his
      cheek paled for the first time, indicating, by a momentary change, that
      the only evidence of agitation he betrayed was occasioned by sympathy in
      the old man&rsquo;s sorrows, rather than by the contemplation of his own fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tragic spirit of the day, however, was still to deepen, and a more
      stunning blow, though less acute in its agony, was to fall upon the
      prisoner. The stir of the calm and solemn jurors, as they issued out of
      their room; the hushed breaths of the spectators, the deadly silence that
      prevails, and the appalling announcement of the word &ldquo;Guilty,&rdquo; are
      circumstances that test in man fortitude, more even than the passing of
      the fearful sentence itself. In the latter case, hope is banished, and the
      worst that can happen known; the mind is, therefore, thrown back upon its
      last energies, which give it strength in the same way in which the
      death-struggle frequently arouses the muscular action of the I body&mdash;an
      unconscious power or resistance that forces the culprit&rsquo;s heart to take
      refuge in the first and strongest instincts of its nature, the undying
      principle of self-preservation. No sooner was the verdict returned and
      silence obtained, than the judge, now deeply affected, put on the black
      cap, at which a low wild murmur of stifled grief and pity rang through the
      court-house; but no sooner was his eye bent on the prisoner than their
      anxiety to hear the sentence hushed them once more into the stillness of
      the grave. The prisoner looked upon him with an open but melancholy gaze,
      which, from the candid and manly character of his countenance, was
      touching in the extreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor O&rsquo;Donovan,&rdquo; said the judge, &ldquo;have you anything to say why sentence
      of death should not be passed upon you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I can say nothing to prevent it. I am prepared for
      it. I know I must bear it, and I hope I will bear it as a man ought, that
      feels his heart free from even a thought of the crime he is to die for. I
      have nothing more to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have this day been found guilty,&rdquo; proceeded the judge, &ldquo;and, in the
      opinion of the court, upon clear and satisfactory evidence, of a crime
      marked by a character of revenge, which I am bound to say must have
      proceeded from a very malignant spirit. It was a wanton act, for the
      perpetration of which your motives were so inadequate, that one must feel
      at a loss to ascertain the exact principle on which you committed it. It
      was also not only a wicked act, but one so mean, that a young man bearing
      the character of spirit and generosity which you have hitherto borne, as
      appears from the testimony of those respectable persons who this day have
      spoken in your favor, ought to have scorned to contemplate it even for a
      moment. Had the passion you entertained for the daughter of the man you so
      basely injured, possessed one atom of the dignity, disinterestedness, or
      purity of true affection, you never could have stooped to any act
      offensive to the object of your love, or to those even in the remotest
      degree related to her. The example, consequently, which you have held out
      to society, is equally vile and dangerous. A parent discharges the most
      solemn and important of all duties, when disposing of his children in
      marriage, because by that act he seals their happiness or misery in this
      life, and most probably in that which is to come. By what tie, by what
      duty, by what consideration, is not a parent bound to consult the best
      interests of those beloved beings whom he has brought into the world, and
      who, in a great measure, depend upon him as their dearest relative, their
      guardian by the voice of nature, for the fulfilment of those expectations
      upon which depend the principal comforts and enjoyments of life? Reason,
      religion, justice, instinct, the whole economy of nature, both in man and
      the inferior animals, all teach him to secure for them, as far as in him
      lies, the greatest sum of human happiness; but if there be one duty more
      sacred and tender than another, it is that which a parent is called upon
      to exercise on behalf of a daughter. The son, impressed by that original
      impulse which moves him to assume a loftier place in the conduct of life,
      and gifted also with a stronger mind, and clearer judgment, to guide him
      in its varied transactions, goes abroad into society, and claims for
      himself a bolder right of thought and a wider range of action, while
      determining an event which is to exercise, as marriage does, such an
      important influence upon his own future condition, and all the relations
      that may arise out of it. From this privilege the beautiful and delicate
      framework of woman&rsquo;s moral nature debars her, and she is consequently
      forced, by the graces of her own modesty&mdash;by the finer texture of her
      mind&mdash;by her greater purity and gentleness&mdash;in short, by all her
      virtues, into a tenderer and more affecting dependence upon the judgment
      and love of her natural guardians, whose pleasure is made, by a wise
      decree of God, commensurate with their duty in providing for her wants and
      enjoyments. There is no point of view in which the parental character
      shines forth with greater beauty than that in which it appears while
      working for and promoting the happiness of a daughter. But you, it would
      seem, did not think so. You punished the father by a dastardly and unmanly
      act, for guarding the future peace and welfare of a child so young, and so
      dear to him. What would become of society if this exercise of a parent&rsquo;s
      right on behalf of his daughter were to be visited upon him as a crime, by
      every vindictive and disappointed man, whose affection for them he might,
      upon proper grounds, decline to sanction? Yet it is singular, and, I
      confess, almost inexplicable to me at least, why you should have rushed
      into the commission of such an act. The brief period of your existence has
      been stained by no other crime. On the contrary, you have maintained a
      character far above your situation in life&mdash;a character equally
      remarkable for gentleness, spirit, truth, and affection&mdash;all of which
      your appearance and bearing have this day exhibited. Your countenance
      presents no feature expressive of ferocity, or of those headlong
      propensities which lead to outrage; and I must confess, that on no other
      occasion in my judicial life have I ever felt my judgment and my feelings
      so much at issue. I cannot doubt your guilt, but I shed those tears that
      it ever existed, and that a youth of so much promise should be cut down
      prematurely by the strong arm of necessary justice, leaving his bereaved
      parents bowed down with despair that can never be comforted. Had they
      another son&mdash;or another child, to whom their affections could turn&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the judge felt it necessary to pause, in consequence of his emotions.
      Strong feelings had, indeed, spread through the whole court, in which,
      while he ceased, could be heard low moanings, and other symptoms of acute
      sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is now your duty to forget every earthly object on which your heart
      may have been fixed, and to seek that source of consolation and mercy
      which can best sustain and comfort you. Go with a penitent heart to the
      throne of your Redeemer, who, if your repentance be sincere, will in no
      wise cast you out. Unhappy youth, prepare yourself, let me implore you,
      for an infinitely greater and more awful tribunal than this. There, should
      the judgment be in your favor, you will learn that the fate, which has cut
      you off in the bloom of early life, will bring an accession of happiness
      to your being for which no earthly enjoyment here, however prolonged or
      exalted, could compensate you. The recommendation of the jury to the mercy
      of the crown, in consideration of your youth and previous good conduct,
      will not be overlooked; but in the mean time the court is bound to
      pronounce upon you the sentence of the law, which is, that you be taken
      from the prison from which you came, on the eighth of next month, at the
      hour of ten o&rsquo;clock in the forenoon, to the front drop of the jail, and
      there hanged by the neck, until you be dead; and may God have mercy on
      your soul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said the prisoner, unmoved in voice or in manner, unless it
      might be that both expressed more decision and energy than he had shown
      during any other part of the trial; &ldquo;my lord, I am now a condemned man,
      but if I stood with the rope about my neck, ready to die, I would not
      exchange situations with the man that has: been my accuser. My lord, I can
      forgive him, and I ought, for I know he has yet to die, and must meet his
      God. As for myself, I am thankful that I have not such a conscience as his
      to bring before my Judge; and for this reason I am not afraid to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was then removed amidst a murmur of grief, as deep and sincere as was
      ever expressed for a human being under circumstances of a similar
      character. After having! entered the prison, he was about to turn along a
      passage which led to the apartment hitherto allotted to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way,&rdquo; said the turnkey, &ldquo;this way; God knows I would be glad to let
      you stop in the room you had, but I haven&rsquo;t the power. We must put you
      into one of the condemned cells; but by &mdash;-, it&rsquo;ll go hard if I don&rsquo;t
      stretch a little to make you as comfortable I as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take no trouble,&rdquo; said Connor, &ldquo;take no trouble. I care now but little
      about my own comfort; but if you wish to oblige me, bring me my father.
      Oh, my mother, my mother!&mdash;you, I doubt, are struck down already!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was too ill to attend the trial to-day,&rdquo; replied the turnkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said Connor; &ldquo;but as she&rsquo;s not here, bring me my father. Send
      out a messenger for him, and be quick, for I wont rest till I see him&mdash;he
      wants comfort&mdash;the old man&rsquo;s heart will break.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard them say,&rdquo; replied the turnkey, after they had entered the cell
      allotted to him, &ldquo;that he was in a faint at Mat Corrigan&rsquo;s public house,
      but that he had recovered. I&rsquo;ll go myself and bring him in to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do,&rdquo; said Connor, &ldquo;an&rsquo; leave us the moment you bring him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was more than an hour before the man I returned, holding Fardorougha by
      the arm, and, after having left him in the cell, he instantly locked it
      outside, and withdrew as he had been desired. Connor ran to support his
      tottering steps; and wofully indeed did unfortunate parent stand in need
      of his assistance. In the picture presented by Fardorougha the unhappy
      young man forgot in a moment his own miserable and gloomy fate. There
      blazed in his father&rsquo;s eyes an excitement at once dead and wild&mdash;a
      vague fire without character, yet stirred by an incomprehensible energy
      wholly beyond the usual manifestations of thought or suffering. The son on
      beholding him shuddered, and not for the first time, for he had on one or
      two occasions before become apprehensive that his father&rsquo;s mind might, if
      strongly pressed, be worn down, by the singular conflict of which it was
      that scene, to that most frightful of all maladies&mdash;insanity. As the
      old man, however, folded him in his feeble arms, and attempted to express
      what he felt, the unhappy boy groaned aloud, and felt even in the depth of
      his cell, a blush of momentary shame suffuse his cheek and brow. His
      father, notwithstanding the sentence that had been so shortly before
      passed upon his son&mdash;that father, he perceived to be absolutely
      intoxicated, or, to use a more appropriate expression, decidedly drunk.
      There was less blame, however, to be attached to Fardorougha on this
      occasion, than Connor imagined. When the old man swooned in the
      court-house, he was taken by his neighbors to a public-house, where he lay
      for some minutes in a state of insensibility. On his recovery he was plied
      with burnt whiskey, as well to restore his strength and prevent a relapse,
      as upon the principle that it would enable him to sustain with more
      firmness the dreadful and shocking destiny which awaited his son. Actuated
      by motives of mistaken kindness, they poured between two and three glasses
      of this fiery cordial down his throat, which, as he had not taken so much
      during the lapse of thirty years before, soon reduced the feeble old man
      to the condition in which we have described him when entering the gloomy
      cell of the prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Connor, &ldquo;in the name of Heaven above, who or what has put
      you into this dreadful state, especially when we consider the hard, hard
      fate that is over us, and upon us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor,&rdquo; returned Fardorougha, not perceiving the drift of his question,
      &ldquo;Connor, my son, I&rsquo;ll hang&mdash;hang him, that&rsquo;s one comfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you spaking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The villain sentence was passed on to&mdash;to&mdash;day. He&rsquo;ll swing&mdash;swing
      for the robbery; P&mdash;&mdash;e will. We got him back out of that nest
      of robbers, the Isle o&rsquo; Man&mdash;o&rsquo; Man they call it&mdash;that he made
      off to, the villain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father dear, I&rsquo;m sorry to see you in this state on sich a day&mdash;sich
      a black day to us. For your sake I am. What will the world say of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor, I&rsquo;m in great spirits all out, exceptin&rsquo; for something that I
      forget, that&mdash;that&mdash;li&mdash;lies heavy upon me. That I mayn&rsquo;t
      sin, but I am&mdash;I am, indeed&mdash;for now that we&rsquo;ve cotch him, we&rsquo;ll
      hang the villain up. Ha, ha, ha, it&rsquo;s a pleasant sight to see sich a
      fellow danglin&rsquo; from a rope!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, sit down here, sit down here upon this bad and comfortless bed,
      and keep yourself quiet for a little. Maybe you&rsquo;ll get better soon. Oh,
      why did you drink, and us in such trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not sit down; I&rsquo;m very well able to stand,&rdquo; said he, tottering
      across the room. &ldquo;The villain thought to starve me, Connor, but you heard
      the sentence that was passed on him to-day. Where&rsquo;s Honor, from me? she&rsquo;ll
      be glad, whin&mdash;whin she hears it, and my son, Connor, will too&mdash;but
      he&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s&mdash;where is Connor?&mdash;bring me, bring me to Connor. Ah,
      avourneen, Honor&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s breaking for him&mdash;&lsquo;t any rate, the
      mother&rsquo;s heart&mdash;the mother&rsquo;s heart&mdash;she&rsquo;s laid low wid an
      achin&rsquo;, sorrowful head for her boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, for God&rsquo;s sake, will you try and rest a little? If you could
      sleep, father dear, if you could sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hang P&mdash;&mdash;e&mdash;I&rsquo;ll hang him&mdash;but if he gives me
      back my money, I&rsquo;ll not touch him. Who are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father dear, I&rsquo;m Connor, your own son, Connor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll marry you and Una, then. I&rsquo;ll settle all the villain robbed me of on
      you, and you&rsquo;ll have every penny of it <i>after my death</i>. Don&rsquo;t be
      keepin&rsquo; me up, I can walk very well; ay, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m in right good spirits.
      Sure, the money&rsquo;s got, Connor&mdash;got back every skilleen of it. Ha, ha,
      ha, God be praised! God be praised! We&rsquo;ve a right to be thankful&mdash;the
      world isn&rsquo;t so bad afther all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, will you try and rest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not bad, afther all&mdash;I won&rsquo;t starve, as I thought I would, now
      that the <i>arrighad</i> is got back from the villain. Ha, ha, ha, it&rsquo;s
      great, Connor, ahagur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, father dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor, sing me a song&mdash;my heart&rsquo;s up&mdash;it&rsquo;s light&mdash;arn&rsquo;t
      you glad?&mdash;sing me a song.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll sleep first, father dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <i>Uligone</i>, Connor, or <i>Shuilagra</i>, or the <i>Trougha</i>&mdash;for,
      avourneen, avourneen, there must be sorrow in it, for my heart&rsquo;s low, and
      your mother&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s in sorrow, an&rsquo; she&rsquo;s lyin&rsquo; far from us, an&rsquo; her
      boy&rsquo;s not near her, an&rsquo; her heart&rsquo;s sore, sore, and her head achin&rsquo;,
      bekase her boy&rsquo;s far from her, and she can&rsquo;t come to him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy, whose noble fortitude was unshaken during the formidable trial it
      had encountered in the course of that day, now felt overcome by this
      simple allusion to his mother&rsquo;s love. He threw his arms about his father&rsquo;s
      neck, and, placing his head upon his bosom, wept aloud for many, many
      minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hiisth, Connor, husth, asthore&mdash;what makes you cry? Sure, all &lsquo;ill
      be right now that we&rsquo;ve got back the money. Eh? Ha, ha, ha, it&rsquo;s great
      luck, Connor, isn&rsquo;t it great? An&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll have it, you an&rsquo; Una, <i>afther
      my death</i>&mdash;for I won&rsquo;t starve for e&rsquo;er a one o&rsquo; yees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, father, I wish you would rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I will, avick, I will&mdash;bring me to bed&mdash;you&rsquo;ll sleep in
      your own bed to-night. Your poor mother&rsquo;s head hasn&rsquo;t been off of the
      place where your own lay, Connor. No, indeed; her heart&rsquo;s low&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      breakin&rsquo;&mdash;it&rsquo;s breakin&rsquo;&mdash;but she won&rsquo;t let anybody make your bed
      but herself. Oh, the mother&rsquo;s love, Connor&mdash;that mother&rsquo;s love, that
      mother&rsquo;s love&mdash;but, Connor&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, father, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there something wrong, avick: isn&rsquo;t there something not right,
      somehow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This question occasioned the son to feel as if his heart would literally
      burst to pieces, especially when he considered the circumstances under
      which the old man put it. Indeed, there was something so transcendently
      appalling in his intoxication, and in the wild but affecting tone of his
      conversation, that, when joined to his pallid and spectral appearance, it
      gave a character, for the time being, of a mood that struck the heart with
      an image more frightful than that of madness itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong, father!&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;all&rsquo;s wrong, and I can&rsquo;t understand it. It&rsquo;s
      wel for you that you don&rsquo;t know the doom that&rsquo;s upon us now, for I feel
      how it would bring you down, and how it will, too. It will kill you, my
      father&mdash;it will kill you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor, come home, avick, come home&mdash;I&rsquo;m tired at any rate&mdash;come
      home to you mother&mdash;come, for her sake&mdash;I know I&rsquo;m not at home,
      an&rsquo; she&rsquo;ll not rest till I bring you safe back to her. Come now, I&rsquo;ll have
      no put offs&mdash;you must come, I say&mdash;I ordher you&mdash;I can&rsquo;t
      and won&rsquo;t meet her wid out you. Come, avick, an&rsquo; you can sing mi the song
      goin&rsquo; home&mdash;come wid your owi poor ould father, that can&rsquo;t live
      widout you&mdash;come, a sullish machree, I don&rsquo;t feel right here&mdash;we
      won&rsquo;t be properly happy till we go to your lovin&rsquo; mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, father, you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re making me suffer! What heart,
      blessed heaven, can bear&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door of his cell here opened, and the turnkey stated that some five or
      six of his friends were anxious to see him, and, above all things, to take
      charge of his father to his own home. This was a manifest relief to the
      young man, who then felt more deeply on his unhappy father&rsquo;s account than
      on his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some foolish friends,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;have given my father liquor, an&rsquo; it has
      got into his head&mdash;indeed, it overcame him the more as I never
      remember him to taste a drop of spirits during his life before. I can see
      no body now an&rsquo; him in this state; but if they wish me well, let them take
      care of him, and leave him safe at his own house, and tell them I&rsquo;ll be
      glad if I can see them tomorrow, or any other time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With considerable difficulty Fardorougha was removed from Connor, whom he
      clung to with all his strength, attempting also to drag him away. He then
      wept bitterly, because he declined to accompany him home, that he might
      comfort his mother, and enjoy the imagined recovery of his money from P&mdash;&mdash;e,
      and the conviction which he believed they had just succeeded in getting
      against that notorious defaulter.
    </p>
    <p>
      After they had departed, Connor sat down upon his hard pallet, and,
      supporting his head with his hand, saw, for the first time, in all its
      magnitude and horror, the death to which he found himself now doomed. The
      excitement occasioned by his trial, and his increasing firmness, as it
      darkened on through all its stages to the final sentence, now had&mdash;in
      a considerable degree abandoned him, and left his heart, at present, more
      accessible to natural weakness than it it had been to the power of his own
      affections. The image of his early-loved Una had seldom since his arrest
      been out of his imagination. Her youth, her beauty, her wild but natural
      grace, and the flashing glances of her dark enthusiastic eye, when joined
      to her tenderness and boundless affection for himself&mdash;all caused his
      heart to quiver with deadly anguish through every fibre. This produced a
      transition to Flanagan&mdash;the contemplation of whose perfidious
      vengeance made him spring from his seat in a paroxysm of indignant but
      intense hatred, so utterly furious that the swelling tempest which it sent
      through his veins caused him to reel with absolute giddiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great God!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;you are just, and will this be suffered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then thought of his parents, and the fiery mood of his mind changed to
      one of melancholy and sorrow. He looked back upon his aged father&rsquo;s
      enduring struggle&mdash;upon the battle of the old man&rsquo;s heart against the
      accursed vice which had swayed its impulses so long&mdash;on the
      protracted conflict between the two energies, which, like contending
      fivmies in the field, had now left little but ruin and desolation behind
      them. His heart, when he brought all these things near him, expanded, and
      like a bird, folded its wings about the gray-haired martyr to the love he
      bore him. But his mother&mdash;the caressing, the proud, the affectionate,
      whose heart, in the vivid tenderness of hope for her beloved boy, had
      shaped out his path in life, as that on which she could brood with the
      fondness of a loving and delighted spirit&mdash;that mother&rsquo;s image, and
      the idea of her sorrows prostrated his whole strength, like that of a
      stricken infant, to the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, mother,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;when I think of what you reared me for,
      and what I am this night, how can my heart do otherwise than break, as
      well on your account as on my own, and for all that love us! Oh! what will
      become of you, my blessed mother? Hard does it go with you that you&rsquo;re not
      about your pride, as you used to call me, now that I&rsquo;m in this trouble, in
      this fate that is soon to cut me down from your loving arms! The thought
      of you is dear to my heart, dear, dearer, dearer than that of any&mdash;than
      my own Una. What will become of her, too, and the old man? Oh, why, why is
      it that the death I am to suffer is to fall so heavily on them that love
      me best?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then returned to his bed, but the cold and dreary images of death and
      ruin haunted his imagination, until the night was far spent, when at
      length he fell into a deep and dreamless sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the sympathy expressed at his trial, our readers may easily conceive
      the profound sorrow which was felt for him, in the district where he was
      known, from the moment the knowledge of his sentence had gone abroad among
      the people. This was much strengthened by that which, whether in man or
      woman, never fails to create an amiable prejudice in its favor&mdash;I
      mean youth and personal beauty. His whole previous character was now
      canvassed with a mournful lenity that brought out his virtues into
      beautiful relief; and the fate of the affectionate son was deplored no
      less than that of the youthful, but rash and inconsiderate lover. Neither
      was the father without his share of compassion, for they could not forget
      that, despite of all his penury and extortion, the old man&rsquo;s heart had
      been fixed, with a strong but uncouth affection, upon his amiable and only
      boy. It was, however, when they thought of his mother, in whose heart of
      hearts he had been enshrined as the idol of her whole affection, that
      their spirits became truly touched. Many a mother assumed in her own
      person, by the force of imagination, the sinking woman&rsquo;s misery, and
      poured forth, in unavailing tears, the undeniable proofs of the sincerity
      with which she participated in Honor&rsquo;s bereavement. As for Flanagan, a
      deadly weight of odium, such as is peculiar to the Informer in Ireland,
      fell upon both him and his. Nor was this all. Aided by that sagacity which
      is so conspicuous in Irishmen, when a vindictive or hostile feeling is
      excited among them, they depicted Flanagan&rsquo;s character with an accuracy
      and truth astonishingly correct and intuitive. Numerous were the instances
      of cowardice, treachery, and revenge remembered against him, by those who
      had been his close and early companions, not one of which would have ever
      occurred to them, were it not that their minds had been thrown back upon
      the scrutiny by the melancholy fate in which he had involved the unhappy
      Connor O&rsquo;Donovan. Had he been a mere ordinary witness in the matter, he
      would have experienced little of this boiling indignation at their hands;
      but first to participate in the guilt, and afterwards, for the sake of the
      reward, or from a worse and more flagitious motive, to turn upon him, and
      become his accuser, even to the taking away of the young man&rsquo;s life&mdash;to
      stag against his companion and accomplice&mdash;this was looked upon as a
      crime ten thousand times more black and damnable than that for which the
      unhappy culprit had been consigned to so shameful a death.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, alas, of what avail was all this sympathy and indignation to the
      unfortunate youth himself or to those most deeply interested in his fate?
      Would not the very love and sorrow felt towards her son fall upon his
      mother&rsquo;s heart with a heavier weight of bitterness and agony? Would not
      his Una&rsquo;s soul be wounded on that account with a sharper and more deadly
      pang of despair and misery? It would, indeed, be difficult to say whether
      the house of Bodagh Buie or that of Fardorougha was then in the deeper
      sorrow. On the morning of Connor&rsquo;s trial, Una arose at an earlier hour
      than usual, and it was observed when she sat at breakfeast, that her cheek
      was at one moment pale as death, and again flushed and feverish. These
      symptoms were first perceived by her affectionate brother, who, on
      witnessing the mistakes she made in pouring out the tea, exchanged a
      glance with his parents, and afterwards asked her to allow him to take her
      place. She laid down the tea-pot, and, looking him mournfully in the face,
      attempted to smile at a request so unusual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Una, dear,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you must allow me. There is no necessity for
      attempting to conceal what you feel&mdash;we all know it&mdash;and if we
      did not, the fact of your having filled the sugar-bowl instead of the
      tea-cup would soon discover it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said nothing, but looked at him again, as if she scarcely comprehended
      what he said. A glance, however, at the sugar-bowl convinced her that she
      was incapable of performing the usual duties of the breakfast table.
      Hitherto she had not raised her eyes to her father or mother&rsquo;s face, nor
      spoken to them as had been her wont, when meeting at that strictly
      domestic meal. The unrestrained sobbings of the mother now aroused her for
      the first time, and on looking up, she saw her father wiping away the big
      tears from his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Una, avourneen,&rdquo; said the worthy man, &ldquo;let John make tay for us&mdash;for,
      God help you, you can&rsquo;t do it. Don&rsquo;t fret, achora machree, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t,
      Una; as God is over me, I&rsquo;d give all I&rsquo;m worth to save him, for your
      sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at her father and smiled again; but that smile cut him to the
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will make the tea myself, father,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;and I <i>won&rsquo;t</i>
      commit any more mistakes;&rdquo; and as she spoke she unconsciously poured the
      tea into the slop&mdash;bowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Avourneen,&rdquo; said her mother, &ldquo;let John do it; acushla machree, let him do
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then rose, and without uttering a word, passively and silently placed
      herself on her brother&rsquo;s chair&mdash;he having, at the same time, taken
      that on which she sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Una,&rdquo; said her father, taking her hand, &ldquo;you must be a good girl, and you
      must have courage; and whatever happens, my darling, you&rsquo;ll pluck up
      strength, I hope, and bear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so, father,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, avourneen machree,&rdquo; said her mother, &ldquo;I would rather see you cryin&rsquo; 
      fifty times over, than smilin&rsquo; the way you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;my heart is sore&mdash;my heart is sore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, ahagur machree; and your hand is tremblin&rsquo; so much that you can&rsquo;t
      bring the tay&mdash;cup to your mouth; but, then, don&rsquo;t smile so
      sorrowfully, anein machree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I cry, mother?&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;I know that Connor is innocent.
      If I knew him to be guilty, I would weep, and I ought to weep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events, Una,&rdquo; said her father, &ldquo;you know it&rsquo;s the government, and
      not us, that&rsquo;s prosecuting him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this Una made no reply, but, thrusting away her cup, she looked with
      the same mournful smile from one to the other of the little circle about
      her. At length she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, I have a request to ask of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s within my power, Una darling, I&rsquo;ll grant it; and if it&rsquo;s not,
      it&rsquo;ll go hard with me but I&rsquo;ll bring it within my power. What is it,
      asthore machree?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In case he&rsquo;s found guilty, to let John put off his journey to Maynooth,
      and stay with me for some time&mdash;it won&rsquo;t be long I&rsquo;ll keep him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it pleases you, darling, he&rsquo;ll never put his foot into Maynooth
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the mother, &ldquo;dhamnho to the step, if you don&rsquo;t wish him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no,&rdquo; said Una, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s only for a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless she desires it, I will never go,&rdquo; replied the loving brother; &ldquo;nor
      will I ever leave you in your sorrow, my beloved and only sister&mdash;never&mdash;never&mdash;so
      long as a word from my lips can give you consolation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The warm tears coursed each other down his cheeks as he spoke, and both
      his parents, on looking at the almost blighted flower before them, wept as
      if the hand of death had already been upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, and John are going to his trial,&rdquo; she observed; &ldquo;for me I like to
      be alone;&mdash;alone; but when you return to-night, let John break it to
      me. I&rsquo;ll go now to the garden. I&rsquo;ll walk about to-day&mdash;only before
      you go, John, I want to speak to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Calmly and without a tear, she then left the parlor, and proceeded to the
      garden, where she began to dress and ornament the hive which contained the
      swarm that Connor had brought to her on the day their mutual attachment
      was first disclosed to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said John, when she had gone, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that Una&rsquo;s heart is
      broken, or if not broken, that she won&rsquo;t survive his conviction long&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      breaking fast&mdash;for my part, in her present state, I neither will nor
      can leave her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The affectionate father made no reply, but, putting his handkerchief to
      his eyes, wept, as did her mother, in silent but bitter grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot spake about it, nor think of it, John,&rdquo; said he, after some
      time, &ldquo;but we must do what we can for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If anything happens her,&rdquo; said the mother, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d never get over it. Oh
      marciful Savior! how could we live widout her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather see her in tears,&rdquo; said John&mdash;&ldquo;I would rather see her
      in outrageous grief a thousand times than in the calm but ghastly
      resolution with which she is bearing herself up against the trial of this
      day. If he&rsquo;s condemned to death, I&rsquo;m afraid that either her health or
      reason will sink under it, and, in that case, God pity her and us, for
      how, as you say, mother, could we afford to lose her? Still let us hope
      for the best. Father, it&rsquo;s time to prepare; get the car ready. I am going
      to the garden, to hear what the poor thing has to say to me, but I will be
      with you soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her brother found her, as we have said, engaged calmly, and with a
      melancholy pleasure, in adorning the hive which, on Connor&rsquo;s account, had
      become her favorite. He was not at all sorry that she had proposed this
      short interview, for, as his hopes of Connor&rsquo;s acquittal were but feeble,
      if, indeed, he could truly be said to entertain any, he resolved, by
      delicately communicating his apprehensions, to gradually prepare her mind
      for the worst that might happen.

    <h2>
      PART V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On hearing his step she raised her head, and advancing towards the middle
      of the garden, took his arm, and led him towards the summer&mdash;house in
      which Connor and she had first acknowledged their love. She gazed
      wistfully upon it after they entered, and wrung her hands, but still shed
      no tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Una,&rdquo; said her brother, &ldquo;you had something to say to me; what is it,
      darling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced timidly at him, and blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be angry with me, John,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;would it be proper for
      me to&mdash;to go&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! to be present at the trial? Dear Una, you cannot think of it. It
      would neither be proper nor prudent, and you surely would not be
      considered indelicate? Besides, even were it not so, your strength is
      unequal to it. No, no, Una dear; dismiss it from your thoughts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear I could not stand it, indeed, John, even if it were proper; but I
      know not what to do; there is a weight like death upon my heart. If I
      could shed a tear it would relieve me; but I cannot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is probably better you should feel so, Una, than to entertain hopes
      upon the matter that may be disappointed. It is always wisest to prepare
      for the worst, in order to avoid the shock that may come upon us, and
      which always falls heaviest when it comes contrary to our expectations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not at all feel well,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;and I have been thinking of the
      best way to break this day&rsquo;s tidings to me, when you come home. If he&rsquo;s
      cleared, say, good-humoredly, &lsquo;Una, all&rsquo;s lost;&rsquo; and if&mdash;if not, oh,
      desire me&mdash;say to me, &lsquo;Una, you had better go to bed, and let yaur
      mother go with you;&rsquo; that will be enough; I will go to bed, and if ever I
      rise from it again, it will not be from a love of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brother, seeing that conversation on the subject of her grief only
      caused her to feel more deeply, deemed it better to terminate than to
      continue a dialogue which only aggravated her sufferings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust and hope, dear Una,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you will observe my father&rsquo;s
      advice, and make at least a worthy effort to support yourself, under what
      certainly is a heavy affliction to you, in a manner becoming your own
      character. For his sake&mdash;for my mother&rsquo;s, and for mine, too, endeavor
      to have courage; be firm&mdash;and, Una, if you take my advice, you&rsquo;ll
      pray to God to strengthen you; for, after all, there is no support in the
      moment of distress and sorrow, like His.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is it not strange, John, that such heavy misfortunes should fall upon
      two persons so young, and who deserve it so little?&rdquo;
     </p>

      &ldquo;It may be a trial sent for your advantage and his; who can say but it may
      yet end for the good of you both? At present, indeed, there is no
      probability of its ending favorably, and, even should it not, we are bound
      to bear with patience such dispensations as the Great Being, to whom we
      owe our existence, and of whose ways we know so little, may think right to
      lay upon us. Now, God bless you, and support you, dear, till I see you
      again. I must go; don&rsquo;t you hear the jaunting-car driving up to the gate;
      be firm&mdash;dear Una&mdash;be firm, and good&mdash;by!&rdquo;

    <p>
      Never was a day spent under the influence of a more terrible suspense than
      that which drank up the strength of this sinking girl during the trial of
      her lover. Actuated by a burning and restless sense of distraction, she
      passed from place to place with that mechanical step which marks those who
      seek for comfort in vain. She retired to her apartment and strove to pray;
      but the effort was fruitless; the confusion of her mind rendered
      connection and continuity of thought and language impossible. At one
      moment she repaired to the scenes where they had met, and again with a hot
      and aching brain, left them with a shudder that arose from a withering
      conception of the loss of him whose image, by their association, was at
      once rendered more distinct and more beloved. Her poor mother frequently
      endeavored to console her, but became too much affected herself to
      proceed. Nor were the servants less anxious to remove the heavy load of
      sorrow which weighed down her young spirit to the earth. Her brief, but
      affecting reply was the same to each.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing can comfort me; my heart is breaking; oh, leave me&mdash;leave me
      to the sorrow that&rsquo;s upon, me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Deep, indeed, was the distress felt on her account, even by the females of
      her father&rsquo;s house, who, that day, shed many bitter tears on witnessing
      the mute but feverish agony of her sufferings. As evening approached she
      became evidently more distracted and depressed; her head, she said, felt
      hot, and her temples occasionally throbbed with considerable violence. The
      alternations of color on her cheek were more frequent than before, and
      their pallid and carmine hues were more alarmingly contrasted. Her weeping
      mother took the stricken one to her bosom, and, after kissing her burning
      and passive lips, pressed her temples with a hope that this might give her
      relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you cry, <i>anien maehree</i>? (daughter of my heart). Thry and
      shed tears; it &lsquo;ill take away this burning pain that&rsquo;s in your poor head;
      oh, thry and let down the tears, and you&rsquo;ll see how it &lsquo;ill relieve I
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;I can shed no tears; I wish they were
      home, for I the worst couldn&rsquo;t be worse than this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, asthore, it couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;it can&rsquo;t; husth! I&mdash;do you hear it?
      There they are; that&rsquo;s the car; ay, indeed, it&rsquo;s at the gate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They both listened for a moment, and the voices of her father and brother
      were distinctly heard giving some necessary orders! to the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, mother,&rdquo; exclaimed Una, pressing her hands upon her heart, &ldquo;my
      heart is bursting, and my temples&mdash;my temples&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chierna yeelish,&rdquo; said the mother, feeling its strong and rapid
      palpitations, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t stand this. Oh, darling of my heart, for the sake
      of your own life, and of the living God, be firm!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment their knock at the hall-door occasioned her to leap with a
      sudden start, almost out of her mother&rsquo;s arms. But, all at once, the
      tumult of that heart ceased, and the vermillion of her cheek changed to
      the hue of death. With a composure probably more the result of weakness
      than fortitude, she clasped her hands, and giving a fixed gaze towards the
      parlor-door, that spoke the resignation of despair, she awaited the
      tidings of her lover&rsquo;s doom. They both entered, and, after a cautious
      glance about the room, immediately perceived the situation in which,
      reclining on her mother&rsquo;s bosom, she lay, ghastly as a corpse, before
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Una, dear,&rdquo; said John, approaching her, &ldquo;I am afraid you are ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She riveted her eyes upon him, as if she would read his soul, but she
      could not utter a syllable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man&rsquo;s countenance became overshadowed by a deep and mournful
      sense of the task he found himself compelled to perform; his voice
      faltered, and his lips trembled, as&mdash;, in a low tone of heartfelt and
      profound sympathy, he exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Una, dear, you had better go to bed, and let my mother stay with you.&rdquo;
       Calmly she heard him, and, rising, she slowly but deliberately left the
      room, and proceeded up stairs with a degree of steadiness which surprised
      her mother. The only words she uttered on hearing this blighting
      communication, were, &ldquo;Come with me, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Una, darling,&rdquo; said the latter when they had reached the bed-room, &ldquo;why
      don&rsquo;t you spake to me? Let me hear your voice, jewel; only let me hear
      your voice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Una stooped and affectionately kissed her, but made no reply for some
      minutes. She then began to undress, which she did in fits and starts;
      sometimes pausing, in evident abstraction, for a considerable time, and
      again resuming the task of preparing for bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; she at length said, &ldquo;my heart is as cold as ice; but my brain is
      burning; feel my temples; how hot they are, and how they beat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, alanna dheelish; your body, as well as your mind, is sick; but
      we&rsquo;ll sind for the doctor, darlin&rsquo;, and you&rsquo;ll soon be betther, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so; and then Connor and I can be married in spite of them. Don&rsquo;t
      they say, mother, that marriages are made in heaven?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do, darlin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I will meet him there. Oh, my head&mdash;my head! I cannot
      bear&mdash;bear this racking pain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her mother, who, though an uneducated woman, was by no means deficient in
      sagacity, immediately perceived that her mind was beginning to exhibit
      symptoms of being unsettled. Having, therefore, immediately called one of
      the maid-servants, she gave her orders to stay with Una, who had now gone
      to bed, until she herself could again return to her. She instantly
      proceeded to the parlor, where her husband and son were, and with a face
      pale from alarm, told them that she feared Una&rsquo;s mind was going.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May the Almighty forbid!&rdquo; exclaimed her father, laying down his knife and
      fork, for they had just sat down to dinner; &ldquo;oh, what makes you say such a
      thing, Bridget? What on earth makes you think it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, mother, tell us at once,&rdquo; inquired the son, rising
      from the table, and walking distractedly across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, she&rsquo;s beginning to rave about him,&rdquo; replied her mother; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s
      afther saying that she&rsquo;ll be married to him in spite o&rsquo; them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In spite o&rsquo; who, Bridget?&rdquo; asked the Bodagh, wiping his eyes&mdash;&ldquo;in
      spite o&rsquo; who does she mane?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I suppose in spite of Flanagan and thim that found him guilty,&rdquo;
       replied his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but what else did she say, mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She axed me if marriages warn&rsquo;t made in heaven; and I tould her that the
      people said so; upon that she said she&rsquo;d meet him there, and then she
      complained of her head. The trewth is, she has a heavy load of sickness on
      her back, and the sorra hour should be lost till we get a docthor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is the truth, mother; I&rsquo;ll go this moment for Dr. H&mdash;&mdash;.
      There&rsquo;s nothing like taking these things in time. Poor Una! God knows this
      trial is a sore one upon a heart so, faithful and affectionate as hers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John, had you not betther ait something before you go?&rdquo; said his father;
      &ldquo;you want it afther the troublesome day you had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied the son; &ldquo;I cannot&mdash;I cannot; I will neither eat
      nor drink till I hear what the doctor will say about her. O, my God!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed, whilst his eyes filled with tears, &ldquo;and is it come to this with
      you, our darling Una?&mdash;I won&rsquo;t lose a moment till I return,&rdquo; he
      added, as he went out; &ldquo;nor will I, under any circumstances, come without
      medical aid of some kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let these things be taken away, Bridget,&rdquo; said the Bodagh; &ldquo;my appetite
      is gone, too; that last news is the worst of all. May the Lord of heaven
      keep our child&rsquo;s mind right! for, oh, Bridget, wouldn&rsquo;t death itself be
      far afore that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going up to her,&rdquo; replied his wife; &ldquo;and may God guard her, and spare
      her safe and sound to us; for what&mdash;what kind of a house would it be
      if she&mdash;&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t think of it. Oh, wurrah, wurrah, this
      night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Until the return of their son, with the doctor, both O&rsquo;Brien and his wife
      hung in a state of alarm bordering on agony over the bed of their beloved
      daughter. Indeed, the rapidity and vehemence with which incoherence,
      accompanied by severe illness, set in, were sufficient to excite the
      greatest alarm, and to justify their darkest apprehensions. Her skin was
      hot almost to burning; her temples throbbed terribly, and such were her
      fits of starting and raving, that they felt as if every minute were an
      hour, until the physician actually made his appearance. Long before tins
      gentleman reached the house, the son had made him fully acquainted with
      what he looked upon as the immediate cause of her illness; not that the
      doctor himself had been altogether ignorant of it, for, indeed, there were
      few persons of any class or condition in the neighborhood to whom that
      circumstance was unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      On examining the diagnostics that presented themselves, he pronounced her
      complaint to be brain fever of the most formidable class, to wit, that
      which arises from extraordinary pressure upon the mind, and unusual
      excitement of the feelings. It was a relief to her family, however, to
      know that beyond the temporary mental aberrations, inseparable from the
      nature of her complaint, there was no evidence whatsoever of insanity.
      They felt grateful to God for this, and were consequently enabled to watch
      her sick-bed with more composure, and to look forward to her ultimate
      recovery with a hope less morbid and gloomy. In this state we are now
      compelled to leave them and her, and to beg the reader will accompany us
      to another house of sorrow, where the mourning was still more deep, and
      the spirits that were wounded driven into all the wild and dreary darkness
      of affliction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our readers cannot forget the helpless state of intoxication, in which
      Fardorougha left his unhappy son on the evening of the calamitous day that
      saw him doomed to an ignominious death. His neighbors, as we then said,
      having procured a car, assisted him home, and would, for his wife&rsquo;s and
      son&rsquo;s sake, have afforded him all the sympathy in their power; he was,
      however, so completely overcome with the spirits he had drank, and an
      unconscious latent feeling of the dreadful sentence that had been
      pronounced upon his son, that he required little else at their hands than
      to keep him steady on the car. During the greater part of the journey
      home, his language was only a continuation of the incoherencies which
      Connor had, with such a humiliating sense of shame and sorrow, witnessed
      in his prison cell. A little before they arrived within sight of his
      house, his companions perceived that he had fallen asleep; but to a
      stranger, ignorant of the occurrences of the day, the car presented the
      appearance of a party returning from a wedding or from some other occasion
      equally festive and social. Most of them were the worse for liquor, and
      one of them in particular had reached a condition which may be too often
      witnessed in this country. I mean that in which the language becomes
      thick; the eye knowing but vacant; the face impudent but relaxed; the
      limbs tottering, and the voice inveterately disposed to melody. The
      general conversation, therefore, of those who accompanied the old man was,
      as is usual with persons so circumstanced, high and windy; but as far as
      could be supposed by those who heard them cheerful and amiable. Over the
      loudness of their dialogue might be heard, from time to time, at a great
      distance, the song of the drunken melodist just alluded to, rising into
      those desperate tones which borrow their drowsy energy from intoxication
      alone. Such was the character of those who accompanied the miser home; and
      such were the indications conveyed to the ears or eyes of I those who
      either saw or heard them, as they approached Fardorougha&rsquo;s dwelling, where
      the unsleeping heart of the mother watched&mdash;and oh! with what a dry
      and burning anguish of expectation, let our readers judge&mdash;for the
      life or death of the only child that God had ever vouchsafed to that
      loving heart on which to rest all its tenderest hopes and affections.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manner in which Honor O&rsquo;Donovan spent that day was marked by an
      earnest and simple piety that would have excited high praise and
      admiration if witnessed in a person of rank or consideration in society.
      She was, as the reader may remember, too ill to be able to attend the
      trial of her son, or as she herself expressed it in Irish, to draw
      strength to her heart by one look at his manly face; by one glance from
      her boy&rsquo;s eye. She resolved, however, to draw consolation from a higher
      source, and to rest the burden of her sorrows, as far as in her lay, upon
      that being in whose hands are the issues of life and death. From the
      moment her husband left the threshold of his childless house on that
      morning until his return, her prayers to God and the saints were truly
      incessant. And who is so well acquainted with the inscrutable ways of the
      Almighty, as to dare assert that the humble supplications of this pious
      and sorrowful mother were not heard and answered? Whether it was owing to
      the fervor of an imagination wrought upon by the influence of a creed
      which nourishes religious enthusiasm in an extraordinary degree, or
      whether it was by direct support from that God who compassionated her
      affliction, let others determine; but certain it is, that in the course of
      that day she gained a calmness and resignation, joined to an increasing
      serenity of heart, such as she had not hoped to feel under a calamity so
      black and terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing the approach of the car which bore her husband home, and on
      listening to the noisy mirth of those, who, had they been sober, would
      have sincerely respected her grief, she put up an inward prayer of
      thanksgiving to God for what she supposed to be the happy event of
      Connor&rsquo;s acquittal. Stunning was the blow, however, and dreadful the
      revulsion of feelings, occasioned by the discovery of this sad mistake.
      When they reached the door she felt still farther persuaded that all had
      ended as she wished, for to nothing else, except the wildness of
      unexpected joy, could she think of ascribing her husband&rsquo;s intoxication.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must carry Fardorougha in,&rdquo; said one of them to the rest; &ldquo;for the
      liquor has fairly overcome him&mdash;he&rsquo;s sound asleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is cleared!&rdquo; exclaimed the mother; &ldquo;he is cleared! My heart tells me
      he has come out without a stain. What else could make his father, that
      never tasted liquor for the last thirty years, be as he is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honor O&rsquo;Donovan,&rdquo; said one of them, wringing her hand as he spoke, &ldquo;this
      has been a black day to you all; you must prepare yourself for bad news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thin Christ and his blessed mother support me, and support us all! but
      what is the worst? oh, what is the worst?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <i>barradh dhu</i>,&rdquo; replied the man, alluding to the black cap which
      the judge puts on when passing sentence of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;may the name of the Lord that sent this upon us be
      praised forever! That&rsquo;s no rason why we shouldn&rsquo;t still put our trust and
      reliance in him. I will show them, by the help of God&rsquo;s grace, an&rsquo; by the
      assistance of His blessed mother, who suffered herself&mdash;an&rsquo; oh, what
      is my sufferin&rsquo;s to her&rsquo;s?&mdash;I will show them I say, that I can bear,
      as a Christian ought, whatever hard fate it may plase the Saviour of the
      earth to lay upon us. I know my son is innocent, an surely, although it&rsquo;s
      hard, hard to part with such a boy, yet it&rsquo;s a consolation to know that
      he&rsquo;ll be better wid God, who is takin&rsquo; him, than ever he&rsquo;d be wid us. So
      the Lord&rsquo;s will be done this night and forever! amin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This noble display of glowing piety and fortitude was not lost upon those
      who witnessed it. After littering these simple but exalted sentiments, she
      crossed herself devoutly, as is the custom, and bowed her head with such a
      vivid sense of God&rsquo;s presence, that it seemed as if she actually stood, as
      no doubt she did, under the shadow of His power. These men, knowing the
      force of her love to that son, and the consequent depth of her misery at
      losing him by a death so shameful and violent, reverently took off their
      hats as she bent her head to express this obedience to the decrees of God,
      and in a subdued tone and manner exclaimed, almost with one voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May God pity you, Honor! for who but yourself would or could act as you
      do this bitther, bitther night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only doin&rsquo; what I ought to do,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;what is religion good
      for if it doesn&rsquo;t keep the heart right an&rsquo; support us undher thrials like
      this; what &lsquo;ud it be then but a name? But how, oh how, came his father to
      be in sich a state on this bitther, bitther night, as you say it is&mdash;aif
      oh! Heaven above sees it&rsquo;s that&mdash;how came his father, I say, into
      sich a state?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They then related the circumstance as it actually happened; and she
      appeared much relieved to hear that his inebriety was only accidental.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that he got it as he did; for, indeed, if he had
      made himself dhrunk this day, as too many like him do on such occasions,
      he never again would appear the same man in my eyes, nor would my heart
      ever more warm to him as it did. But thanks to God that he didn&rsquo;t take it
      himself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then heard, with a composure that could result only from fortitude and
      resignation united, a more detailed account of her son&rsquo;s trial, after
      which she added&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As God is above me this night I find it asier to lose Connor than to
      forgive the man that destroyed him; but this is a bad state of heart, that
      I trust my Saviour will give me grace to overcome; an&rsquo; I know He will if I
      ax it as I ought; at all events, I won&rsquo;t lay my side on a bed this night
      antil I pray to God to forgive Bartle Flanagan an&rsquo; to turn his heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then pressed them, with a heart as hospitable as it was pious, to
      partake of food, which they declined, from a natural reluctance to give
      trouble where the heart is known to be pressed down by the violence of
      domestic calamity. These are distinctions which our humble countrymen draw
      with a delicacy that may well shame those who move in a higher rank of
      life. Respect for unmerited affliction, and sympathy for the sorrows of
      the just and virtuous, are never withheld by the Irish peasant when
      allowed by those who can guide him either for goqd or for evil to follow
      the impulses of his own heart. The dignity, for instance, of Honor
      O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s bearing under a trial so overwhelming in its nature, and the
      piety with which she supported it, struck them, half tipsy as they were,
      so forcibly, that they became sobered down&mdash;some of them into a full
      perception of her firmness and high religious feelings; and those who were
      more affected by drink into a maudlin gravity of deportment still more
      honorable to the admirable principles of the woman who occasioned it.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the latter, for instance, named Bat Hanratty, exclaimed, after they
      had bade her good, night, and expressed their unaffected sorrow for the
      severe loss she was about to sustain:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, you may all talk; but be the powdhers o&rsquo; delf, nothin&rsquo; 
      barrin&rsquo; the downright grace o&rsquo; God could sup&mdash;sup&mdash;port that
      dacent mother of ould Fardorougha&mdash;I mane of his son, poor Connor.
      But the truth is, you see, that there&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo;&mdash;nothin&rsquo; no, the
      divil saize the hap&rsquo;o&rsquo;rth at all, good, bad, or indifferent aquil to
      puttin&rsquo; your trust in God; bekase, you see&mdash;Con Roach, I say&mdash;bekase
      you see, when a man does that as he ought to do it; for it&rsquo;s all
      faisthelagh if you go the wrong way about it; but Con&mdash;Condy, I say,
      you&rsquo;re a dacent man, an&rsquo; it stands to raison&mdash;it does, boys&mdash;upon
      my soul it does. It wasn&rsquo;t for nothin&rsquo; that money was lost upon myself,
      when I was takin&rsquo; in the edjigation; and maybe, if Connor O&rsquo;Donovan, that
      is now goin&rsquo; to suffer, poor fellow&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     For the villain swore away my life, an&rsquo; all by perjuree;
     And for that same I die wid shame upon the gallows tree.
</pre>
    <p>
      So, as I was sayin&rsquo;, why didn&rsquo;t Connor come in an&rsquo; join the boys like
      another, an&rsquo; then we could settle Bartle for staggin&rsquo; against him. For,
      you see, in regard o&rsquo;. that, Condy, it doesn&rsquo;t signify a traneen whether
      he put a match to the haggard or not; the thing is, you know, that even if
      he did, Bartle daren&rsquo;t sweat against him widout breakin&rsquo; his first oath to
      the boys; an&rsquo; if he did it afther that, an&rsquo; brought any of them into
      throuble conthrary to the articles, be gorra he&rsquo;d be entitled to get a
      gusset opened undher one o&rsquo; his ears, any how. But you see, Con, be the
      book&mdash;God pardon me for swearin&rsquo;&mdash;but be the book, the mother
      has the thrue! ralligion in her heart, or she&rsquo;d never stand it the way she
      does, an&rsquo; that proves what I was axpoundin&rsquo;; that afther all, the sorra
      hap&rsquo;-o&rsquo;rth aquil to the grace o&rsquo; God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then sang a comic song, and, having passed an additional eulogium on
      the conduct of Honor O&rsquo;Donovan, concluded by exhibiting some rather
      unequivocal symptoms of becoming pathetic from sheer sympathy; after which
      the stiporific effect of his libations soon hushed him into a snore that
      acted as a base to the shrill tones in which his companions I addressed
      one another from each side of the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fardorougha, ever, since the passion of avarice had established its
      accursed dominion in his heart, narrowed by degrees his domestic
      establishment, until, towards the latter years of his life, it consisted
      of only a laboring boy, as the term is, and a servant girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, no miser was ever known to maintain a large household; and that
      for reasons too obvious to be detailed. Since Connor&rsquo;s incarceration,
      however, his father&rsquo;s heart had so far expanded, that he hired two men as
      inside servants, one of them, now the father of a large family, being the
      identical Nogher M&rsquo;Cormick, who, as the reader remembers, was in his
      service at the time of Connor&rsquo;s birth. The other was a young man named
      Thaddy Star, or Reillaghan, as it is called in Irish, who was engaged upon
      the recommendation of Biddy Nulty, then an established favorite with her
      master and mistress, in consequence of her faithful devotion to! them and
      Connor, and her simple-hearted participation in their heavy trouble. The
      manner in which they received the result of her son&rsquo;s trial was not indeed
      calculated to sustain his mother. In the midst of the clamor, however, she
      was calm and composed; but it would have been evident, to a close
      observer, that a deep impression of religious duty alone sustained her,
      and that the yearnings of the mother&rsquo;s heart, though stilled by
      resignation to the Divine Will, were yet more intensely agonized by the
      suppression of what she secretly felt. Such, however, is the motive of
      those heroic acts of self-denial, which religion only can enable us to
      perform. It does not harden the heart, or prevent it from feeling the full
      force of the calamity or sorrow which comes upon us; no, but whilst we
      experience it in all the rigor of distress, it teaches us to reflect that
      suffering is our lot, and that it is our duty to receive these severe
      dispensations in such a manner as to prevent others from being corrupted
      by our impatience, or by our open want of submission to the decrees of
      Providence. When the agony of the Man of Sorrow was at its highest, He
      retired to a solitary place, and whilst every pore exuded water and blood,
      he still exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;Not My will, but Thine be done.&rdquo; Here was
      resignation, indeed, but at the same time a heart exquisitely sensible of
      all it had to bear. And much, indeed, as yet lay before that of the pious
      mother of our unhappy hero, and severe was the trial which, on this very
      night, she was doomed to encounter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Fardorougha awoke, which he did not do until about three o&rsquo;clock in
      the morning, he looked wildly about him, and, starting up in the bed, put
      his two hands on his temples, like a man distracted by acute pain; yet
      anxious to develop in his memory the proceedings of the foregoing day. The
      inmates, however, were startled from their sleep by a shriek, or rather a
      yell, so loud and unearthly that in a few minutes they stood collected
      about his bed. It would be impossible, indeed, to conceive, much less to
      describe, such a picture of utter horror as then presented itself to their
      observation. A look that resembled the turbid glare of insanity was
      riveted upon them whilst he uttered shriek after shriek, without the power
      of articulating a syllable. The room, too, was dim and gloomy; for the
      light of the candle that was left burning beside him had become ghastly
      for want of snuffing. There he sat&mdash;his fleshless hands pressed
      against his temples; his thin, gray hair standing out wildly from his
      head; his lips asunder; and his cheeks sucked in so far that the chasms
      occasioned in his jawbones, by the want of his back teeth, were plainly
      visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chiemah dheelish,&rdquo; exclaimed Honor, &ldquo;what is this? as Heaven&rsquo;s above me,
      I believe he&rsquo;s dyin&rsquo;; see how he gasps! Here, Fardorougha,&rdquo; she exclaimed,
      seizing a jug of water which had been left on a chair beside him, but
      which he evidently did not see, &ldquo;here, here, darlin&rsquo;, wet your lips; the
      cool water will refresh you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He immediately clutched the jug with eager and trembling hands, and at one
      rapid draught emptied it to the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;I can spake, now I can spake. Where&rsquo;s my son? where&rsquo;s
      my son? an&rsquo; what has happened me? how did I come here? was I mad? am I
      mad? but tell me, tell me first, where&rsquo;s Connor? Is it thrue? is it all
      thrue? or is it me that&rsquo;s mad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fardorougha, dear,&rdquo; said his wife, &ldquo;be a man, or, rather, be a Christian.
      It was God gave Connor to us, and who has a better right to take him back
      from us? Don&rsquo;t go flyin&rsquo; in His face, bekase He won&rsquo;t ordher everything as
      you wish. You haven&rsquo;t taken off of you to-night, so rise, dear, and calm
      yourself; then go to your knees, lift your heart to God, and beg of Him to
      grant you stringth and patience. Thry that coorse, avoumeen, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll
      find it the best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did I come home I say, Oh tell me Honor, was I out of my wits?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fainted,&rdquo; she replied; they gave you whiskey to support you; an&rsquo; not
      bein&rsquo; accustomed to it, it got into your head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Honor, our son, our son!&rdquo; he replied; then, starting out of the bed
      in a fit of the wildest despair, he clasped his handy together, and
      shrieked out, &ldquo;Oh, our son, our son, our son Connor! Merciful Saviour, how
      will I name it? to be hanged by the neck! Oh, Honor, Honor, don&rsquo;t you pity
      me? don&rsquo;t you pity me? Mother of Heaven, this night? That barradh dim,
      that barradh dim, put on for our boy, our innocent boy; who can
      undherstand it, Honor? It&rsquo;s not justice; there&rsquo;s no justice in Heaven, or
      my son wouldn&rsquo;t be murdhered, slaughtered down in the prime of his life,
      for no rason! But no matther; let him be taken; only hear this: if he
      goes, I&rsquo;ll never,bend my knee to a single prayer while I&rsquo;ve life; for it&rsquo;s
      terrible, it&rsquo;s cruel, &lsquo;tisn&rsquo;t justice; nor do I care what becomes of me,
      either in this world or the other. All I want, Honor, is to folly him as
      soon as I can; my hopes, my happiness, my life, my everything, is gone wid
      him; an&rsquo; what need I care, thin, what becomes of me? I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The faces of the domestics grew pale as they heard, with silent horror,
      the incoherent blasphemies of the frantic miser; but his wife, whose eyes
      were riveted on him while he spoke, and paced, with a hurried step, up and
      down the room, felt at a loss whether to attribute his impiety to an
      attack of insanity, or to a temporary fever, brought on by his late
      sufferings and the intoxication of the preceding night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, Fardorougha,&rdquo; she said
      calmly, placing her hand upon his shoulder, &ldquo;are you sinsible that you&rsquo;re
      this minute afther blasphemin&rsquo; your Creator?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave her a quick, disturbed, and peevish look, but made no reply. She
      then proceeded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fardorougha, I thought the loss of Connor the greatest punishment that
      could be put upon me; but I find I was mistaken. I would rather see him
      dead to-morrow, wid, wid the rope about his neck, than to hear his father
      blasphemin&rsquo; the livin&rsquo; God! Fardorougha, it&rsquo;s clear that you&rsquo;re not now
      fit to pray for yourself, but, in the name of our Saviour, I&rsquo;ll go an&rsquo; 
      pray for you. In the mean time, go to bed; sleep will settle your head,
      and you will be better, I trust, in the mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The calm solemnity of her manner awed him, notwithstanding the vehemence
      of his grief. He stood and looked at her, with his hands tightly clasped,
      as she went to her son&rsquo;s bedroom, in order to pray for him. For a moment,
      he seemed abashed and stunned. While she addressed him, he involuntarily
      ceased to utter those sounds of anguish which were neither shrieks nor
      groans, but something between both. He theli resumed his pace, but with a
      more settled step, and for some minutes maintained perfect silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get me,&rdquo; said he, at length, &ldquo;get me a drink of wather; I&rsquo;m in a flame
      wid drouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Biddy Nulty went out to fetch him this, he inquired of the rest what
      Honor meant by charging him with blasphemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely to God, I didn&rsquo;t blasphame,&rdquo; he said, peevishly; &ldquo;no, no, I&rsquo;m not
      that bad; but any how, let her pray for me; her prayer will be heard, if
      ever woman&rsquo;s was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Biddy returned, he emptied the jug of water with the same trembling
      eagerness as before; then clasped his hands again, and commenced pacing
      the room, evidently in a mood of mind about to darken into all the
      wildness of his former grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fardorougha,&rdquo; said Nogher M&rsquo;Cormick; &ldquo;I was undher this roof the night
      your manly son was born. I remimber it well; an&rsquo; I remimber more betoken,
      I had to check you for flying in the face o&rsquo; God that sent him to you.
      Instead o&rsquo; feelin&rsquo; happy and delighted, as you ought to ha&rsquo; done, an&rsquo; as
      any other man but yourself would, you grew dark an&rsquo; sulky, and grumbled
      bekase you thought there was a family comin&rsquo;. I tould you that night to
      take care an&rsquo; not be committing sin; an&rsquo; you may renumber, too, that I gev
      you chapter an&rsquo; verse for it out o&rsquo; Scripture: &lsquo;Woe be to the man that&rsquo;s
      born wid a millstone about his neck, especially if he&rsquo;s to be cast into
      the say.&rsquo; The truth is, Fardorougha, you warn&rsquo;t thankful to God for him;
      and you see that afther all, it doesn&rsquo;t do to go to loggerheads wid the
      Almighty. Maybe, had you been thankful for him, he wouldn&rsquo;t be where he is
      this night. Millstone! Faith, it was a home thrust, that same verse; for
      if you didn&rsquo;t carry the millstone about your neck, you had it in your
      heart; an&rsquo; you now see and feel the upshot. I&rsquo;m now goin&rsquo; fast into age
      myself; my hair is grayer than your own, and I could take it to my death,&rdquo;
       said the honest fellow, while a tear or two ran slowly down his cheek;
      &ldquo;that, exceptin&rsquo; one o&rsquo; my own childre&rsquo;, an&rsquo; may God spare them to me! I
      couldn&rsquo;t feel more sorrow at the fate of any one livin&rsquo;, than at Connor&rsquo;s.
      Many a time I held him in these arms, an&rsquo; many a little play I made for
      him; an&rsquo; many a time he axed me why his father didn&rsquo;t nurse him as I did;&rsquo; 
      bekase,&rsquo; he used to say, &lsquo;I would rather he would nurse me than anybody
      else, barring my mother; and, afther him, you, Nogher.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These last observations of his servant probed the heart of the old man to
      the quick; but the feeling which they excited was a healthy one; or,
      rather, the associations they occasioned threw Fardorougha&rsquo;s mind upon the
      memory of those affections, which avarice had suppressed, without
      destroying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I loved him, Nogher,&rdquo; said he, deeply agitated; &ldquo;Oh none but God knows
      how I loved him, although I didn&rsquo;t an&rsquo; couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to show it at
      the time. There was something upon me; a curse, I think, that prevented
      me; an&rsquo; now that I love him as a father ought to do, I will not have him.
      Oh, my son, my son, what will become of me, after you? Heavenly Father,
      pity me and support me! Oh, Connor, my son, my son, what will become of
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then sat down on the bed, and, placing his hands upon his face, wept
      long and bitterly. His grief now, however, was natural, for, during the
      most violent of his paroxysms in the preceding hour, he shed not a tear;
      yet now they ran down his cheeks, and through his fingers, in torrents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cry on, cry on,&rdquo; said Nogher, wiping his own eyes; &ldquo;it will lighten your
      heart; an&rsquo; who knows but it&rsquo;s his mother&rsquo;s prayers that brought you to
      yourself, and got this relief for you. Go, Biddy,&rdquo; said he, in a whisper,
      to the servant-maid, &ldquo;and tell the mistress to come here; she&rsquo;ll know best
      how to manage him, now that he&rsquo;s a little calm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God be praised!&rdquo; ejaculated Honor, on seeing him weep; &ldquo;these tears will
      cool your head, avourneen; an&rsquo; now, Fardorougha, when you&rsquo;re tired cryin&rsquo;,
      if you take my advice, you&rsquo;ll go to your knees an&rsquo; offer up five pathers,
      five Aves, an&rsquo; a creed, for the grace of the Almighty to direct and
      strengthen you; and thin, afther that, go to bed, as I sed, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll
      find how well you&rsquo;ll be afther a sound sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honor,&rdquo; replied her husband, &ldquo;avourneen machree, I think you&rsquo;ll save your
      husband&rsquo;s sowl yet, undhor my merciful Saviour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your son, undher the same merciful God, will do it. Your heart was hard
      and godless, Fardorougha, and, surely, if Connor&rsquo;s death &lsquo;ll be the manes
      of savin&rsquo; his father&rsquo;s sowl, wouldn&rsquo;t it be a blessin&rsquo; instead of a
      misfortune? Think of it in that light, Fardorougha, and turn your heart to
      God. As for Connor, isn&rsquo;t it a comfort to know that the breath won&rsquo;t be
      out of his body till he&rsquo;s a bright angel in heaven?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man wiped his eyes and knelt down, first having desired them to
      leave him. When the prayers were recited he called in Honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afeard,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that my heart wasn&rsquo;t properly in them, for I
      couldn&rsquo;t prevent my mind from wanderin&rsquo; to our boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This touching observation took the mother&rsquo;s affections by surprise. A tear
      started to her eye, but, after what was evidently a severe struggle, she
      suppressed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not at once you can do it, Fardorougha; so don&rsquo;t be cast down. Now,
      go to bed, in the name of God, and sleep; and may the Lord in heaven
      support you&mdash;and support us both! for oh! it&rsquo;s we that want it this
      night of sorrow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then stooped down and affectionately kissed him, and, having wished
      him good night, she retired to Connor&rsquo;s bed, where, ever since the day of
      his incarceration, this well-tried mother and enduring Christian slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this stage of our story we will pause, for a moment, to consider the
      state of mind and comparative happiness of the few persons who are actors
      in our humble drama.
    </p>
    <p>
      To a person capable of observing only human action, independently of the
      motives by which it is regulated, it may appear that the day which saw
      Connor O&rsquo;Donovan consigned to a premature and shameful death, was one of
      unmingled happiness to Bartle Flanagan. They know little of man&rsquo;s heart,
      however, who could suppose this to be the case, or, who could even imagine
      that he was happier than those on whom his revenge and perfidy had
      entailed such a crushing load of misery. It is, indeed, impossible to
      guess what the nature of that feeling must be which arises from the full
      gratification of mean and diabolic malignity. Every action of the heart at
      variance with virtue and truth is forced to keep up so many minute and
      fearful precautions, all of which are felt to be of vast moment at the
      time, that we question if ever the greatest glut of vengeance produced, no
      matter what the occasion may have been, any satisfaction capable of
      counterbalancing all the contigencies and apprehensions by which the mind
      is distracted both before and after its preparation. The plan and
      accomplishment must both be perfect in all their parts&mdash;for if either
      fail only in a single point, all is lost, and the pleasure arising from
      them resembles the fruit which is said to grow by the banks of the Dead
      Sea&mdash;it is beautiful and tempting to the eye, but bitterness and
      ashes to the taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      The failing of the county treasurer, for instance, deprived Bartle
      Flanagan of more than one half his revenge. He was certainly far more
      anxious to punish the father than the son, and were it not that he saw no
      other mode of effecting his vengeance on Fardorougha, than by destroying
      the only object on earth that he loved next to his wealth, he would have
      never made the innocent pay the penalty of the guilty. As he had gone so
      far, however, self-preservation now made him anxious that Connor should
      die; as he knew his death would remove out of his way the only person in
      existence absolutely acquainted with his villany. One would think, indeed,
      that the sentence pronounced upon his victim ought to have satisfied him
      on that head. This, however, it failed to do. That sentence contained one
      clause, which utterly destroyed the completeness of his design, and filled
      his soul with a secret apprehension either of just retribution, or some
      future ill which he could not shake off, and for which the reward received
      for Connor&rsquo;s apprehension was but an ineffectual antidote. The clause
      alluded to in the judge&rsquo;s charge, viz.&mdash;&ldquo;the recommendation of the
      jury to the mercy of the Crown, in consideration of your youth, and
      previous good conduct, shall not be overlooked&rdquo;&mdash;sounded in his ears
      like some mysterious sentence that involved his own fate, and literally
      filled his heart with terror and dismay. Independently of all this his
      villanous projects had involved him in a systematic course of guilt, which
      was yet far from being brought to a close. In fact, he now found by
      experience how difficult it is to work out a bad action with success, and
      how the means, and plans, and instruments necessary to it must multiply
      and become so deep and complicated in guilt, that scarcely any single
      intellect, in the case of a person who can be reached by the laws, is
      equal to the task of executing a great crime against society, in a perfect
      manner. If this were so, discovery would be impossible, and revenge
      certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      With respect to Connor himself it is only necessary to say that a short
      but well-spent life, and a heart naturally firm, deprived death of its
      greatest terrors. Still he felt it, in some depressed moods, a terrible
      thing indeed to reflect, that he, in the very fullness of strength and
      youth, should be cut down from among his fellows&mdash;a victim without a
      crime, and laid with shame in the grave of a felon. But he had witnessed
      neither his mother&rsquo;s piety nor her example in vain, and it was in the
      gloom of his dungeon that he felt the light of both upon his spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as I am to die, is it not better that I should die
      innocent than guilty? Instead of fretting that I suffer, a guiltless man,
      surely I ought to thank God that I am so; an&rsquo; that my soul hasn&rsquo;t to meet
      the sin of such a revengeful act as I&rsquo;m now condemned for. I&rsquo;ll die, then,
      like a Christian man, putting my hope and trust in the mercy of my
      Redeemer&mdash;ever an&rsquo; always hoping that by His assistance I will be
      enabled to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Different, indeed, were the moral state and position of these two young
      men; the one, though lying in his prison cell, was sustained by the force
      of conscious innocence, and that reliance upon the mercy of God, which
      constitutes the highest order of piety, and the noblest basis of
      fortitude; the other, on the contrary, disturbed by the tumultuous and
      gloomy associations of guilt, and writhing under the conviction, that,
      although he had revenge, he had not satisfaction. The terror of crime was
      upon him, and he felt himself deprived of that best and only security,
      which sets all vain apprehensions at defiance, the consciousness of inward
      integrity. Who, after all, would barter an honest heart for the danger
      arising from secret villany, when such an apparently triumphant villain as
      Bartle Flanagan felt a deadly fear, of Connor O&rsquo;Donovan in his very
      dungeon? Such, however, is guilt, and such are the terrors that accompany
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The circumstances which, in Ireland, usually follow the conviction of a
      criminal, are so similar to each other, that we feel it, even in this
      case, unnecessary to do more than give a mere sketch of Connor&rsquo;s brief
      life as a culprit. We have just observed that the only clause in the
      judge&rsquo;s charge which smote the heart of the traitor, Flanagan, with a
      presentiment of evil, was that containing the words in which something
      like a, hope of having his sentence mitigated was held out to him, in
      consequence of the recommendation to mercy by which the jury accompanied
      their verdict. It is very strange, on the other hand, that, at the present
      stage of our story, neither his father nor mother knew anything whatsoever
      of the judge having given expression to such a hope. The old man,
      distracted as he was at the time, heard nothing, or at least remembered
      nothing, but the awful appearance of the black cap, or, as they term it in
      the country, the barradh dhu, and the paralyzing words in which the
      sentence of death was pronounced upon his son. It consequently happened
      that the same clause in the charge actually, although in a different
      sense, occasioned the misery of Bartle Flanagan on the one hand, and of
      Connor&rsquo;s parents on the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning after the trial, Fardorougha was up as early as usual, but his
      grief was nearly as vehement and frantic as on the preceding night. It was
      observed, however&mdash;such is the power of sorrow to humanize and create
      sympathy in the heart&mdash;that, when he arose, instead of peevishly and
      weakly obtruding his grief and care upon those about him, as he was wont
      to do, he now kept aloof from the room in which Honor slept, from an
      apprehension of disturbing her repose&mdash;a fact which none who knew his
      previous selfishness would have believed, had he not himself expressed in
      strong terms a fear of awakening her. Nor did this new trait of his
      character escape the observation of his own servants, especially of his
      honest monitor, Nogher M&rsquo;Cormick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; exclaimed this rustic philosopher; &ldquo;see what God&rsquo;s
      affliction does. Faith, it has brought Fardorougha to feel a trifle for
      others, as well as for himself. Who knows, begad, but it may take the
      millstone out of his heart yet; and if it does, my word to you, he may
      thank his wife, undher God, for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before leaving home that morning to see his son, he found with deep regret
      that Honor&rsquo;s illness had been so much increased by the events of the
      preceding day, that she could not leave her bed. And now, for the first
      time, a thought, loaded with double anguish, struck upon his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saver of earth!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;what would become of me if both should go
      and lave me alone? God of heaven, alone! Ay, ay,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I see it.
      I see how asily God might make my situation still worse than I thought it
      could be. Oh God, forgive me my sins; and may God soften my heart! Amin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then went to see his wife ere he set out for his unhappy son; and it
      was with much satisfaction that Honor observed a changed and chastened
      tone in his manner, which she had never, except for a moment at the birth
      of his child, noticed before. Not that his grief was much lessened, but it
      was more rational, and altogether free from the violence and impiety which
      had characterized it when he awoke from his intoxication.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honor,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;how do you find yourself this mornin&rsquo;, alanna? They
      tell me you&rsquo;re worse than you Wor yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I&rsquo;m wake enough,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;and very much bate down,
      Fardorougha; but you know it&rsquo;s not our own stringth at any time that we&rsquo;re
      to depend upon, but God&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;m not willing to attempt anything beyant my
      power at present. My seeing him now would do neither of us any good, and
      might do me a great dale o&rsquo; harm. I must see him, to be sure, and I&rsquo;ll
      strive, plase God, to gather up a little strength for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My heart&rsquo;s breakin&rsquo;, Honor, and I&rsquo;m beginnin&rsquo; to see that I&rsquo;ve acted a
      bad part to both of you all along. I feel it, indeed; and if it was the
      will of God, I didn&rsquo;t care if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whisht, accushla, whisht&mdash;sich talk as that&rsquo;s not right. Think,
      Fardorougha, whether you acted a bad part towards God or not, and never
      heed us; an&rsquo; think, too, dear, whether you acted a bad or a good part
      towards the poor, an&rsquo; them that was in distress and hardship, an&rsquo; that
      came to you for relief; they were your fellow-crathers, Fardorougha, at
      all evints. Think of these things I&rsquo;m sayin, and never heed us. You know
      that Connor and I forgive you, but you arn&rsquo;t so sure whether God and them
      will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These observations of this estimable woman had the desired effect, which
      was, as she afterwards said, to divert her husband&rsquo;s mind as much as
      possible from the contemplation of Connor&rsquo;s fate, and to fix it upon the
      consideration of those duties in which she knew his conscience, now
      touched by calamity, would tell him he had been deficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fardorougha was silent for some time after her last observations&mdash;but
      at length he observed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it be possible, Honor, that all this was brought upon us in ordher
      to punish me for&mdash;for&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To punish you, Fardorougha? Fareer gaih avourneen, arn&rsquo;t we all punished?
      look at my worn face, and think of what ten days&rsquo; sorrow can do in a
      mother&rsquo;s heart&mdash;think, too, of the boy. Oh no, no&mdash;do you think
      I&rsquo;ve have nothin&rsquo; to be punished for? But we have all one comfort,
      Fardorougha, and that is, that God&rsquo;s ever and always willin&rsquo; to re-save
      us, when we turn to Him wid a true heart? Nobody, avillish, can forget and
      forgive as He does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honor, why didn&rsquo;t you oftener spake to me this a-way than you did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I often did, dear, an&rsquo; you may remember it; but you were then strong; you
      had your wealth; everything flowed wid you, an&rsquo; the same wealth&mdash;the
      world&rsquo;s temptation&mdash;was strong in your heart; but God has taken it
      from you I hope as a blessing&mdash;for, indeed, Fardorougha, I&rsquo;m afeard
      if you had it now, that neither he nor&mdash;but I won&rsquo;t say it, dear, for
      God sees I don&rsquo;t wish to say one word that &lsquo;ud distress you now,
      avourneen. Any how, Fardorougha, never despair in God&rsquo;s goodness&mdash;never
      do it; who can tell what may happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her husband&rsquo;s grief was thus checked, and a train of serious reflection
      laid, which, like some of those self-evident convictions that fastened on
      the awakened conscience, the old man could not shake off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honor, in her further conversation with him, touching the coming interview
      with the unhappy culprit, desired him, above all things, to set &ldquo;their
      noble boy&rdquo; an example of firmness, and by no means to hold out to him any
      expectation of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be worse than murdher,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;to do so. No&mdash;prepare
      him by your advice, Fardorougha, ay, and by your example, to be firm&mdash;and
      tell him that his mother expects he will die like an innocent man&mdash;noble
      and brave&mdash;and not like a guilty coward, afeard to look up and meet
      his God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Infidels and hypocrites, so long as their career in vice is unchecked by
      calamity, will no doubt sneer when we assure them, that Fardorougha, after
      leaving his wife that morning once more to visit his son, felt a sense of
      relief, or, perhaps we should say, a breaking of faint light upon his
      mind, which, slight as it was, afforded him more comfort and support than
      he ever hoped to experience. Indeed, it was almost impossible for any
      heart to exist within the influence of that piety which animated his
      admirable wife, and not catch the holy fire which there burned with such
      purity and brightness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ireland, however, abounds with such instances of female piety and
      fortitude, not, indeed, as they would be made to appear in the unfeminine
      violence of political turmoil, in which a truly pious female would not
      embroil herself; but in the quiet recesses of domestic life&mdash;in the
      hard struggles against poverty, and in those cruel visitations, where the
      godly mother is forced to see her innocent son corrupted by the dark
      influence of political crime, drawn within the vortex of secret
      confederacy, and subsequently yielding up his life to the outraged laws of
      that country which he assisted to distract. It is in scenes like these
      that the unostentatious magnanimity of the pious Irish wife or mother may
      be discovered; and it is here where, as the night and storms of life
      darken her path, the holy fortitude of her heart shines with a lustre
      proportioned to the depth of the gloom around her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Fardorougha reached the town in which his ill-fated son occupied the
      cell of a felon, he found to his surprise that, early as were his habits,
      there were others whose movements were still more early than his own. John
      O&rsquo;Brien had come to town&mdash;been with his attorney&mdash;had got a
      memorial in behalf of Connor to the Irish government, engrossed, and
      actually signed by more than one&mdash;half of the jury who tried him&mdash;all
      before the hour of ten o&rsquo;clock. A copy of thi&rsquo;s document, which was
      written by O&rsquo;Brien himself, now lies before us, with the names of all the
      jurors attached to it; and a more beautiful or affecting piece of
      composition we have never read. The energy and activity of O&rsquo;Brien were
      certainly uncommon, and so, indeed, were his motives. As he himself told
      Fardorougha, whom he met as the latter entered the town&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would do what I have done for Connor, although I have never yet
      exchanged a syllable with him. Yet, I do assure you, Fardorougha, that I
      have other motives&mdash;which you shall never know&mdash;far stronger
      than any connected with the fate of your son. Now, don&rsquo;t misunderstand
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the helpless old man, who was ignorant of the condition of
      his sister, &ldquo;I will not, indeed&mdash;I&rsquo;d be long sarry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      O&rsquo;Brien saw that any rational explanation he might give would be only
      thrown away upon a man who seemed to be so utterly absorbed and stupefied
      by the force of his own sufferings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old man,&rdquo; he exclaimed, as Fardorougha left him, to visit Connor;
      &ldquo;see what affliction does? There are thousands now who pity you&mdash;even
      you, whom almost every one who knew you, cursed and detested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such, indeed, was the fact. The old man&rsquo;s hardness of heart was forgotten
      in the pity that was produced by the dreadful fate which awaited his
      unhappy son. We must now pass briefly over occurrences which are better
      understood when left to the reader&rsquo;s imagination. John O&rsquo;Brien was not the
      only one who interested himself in the fate of Connor. Fardorougha, as a
      matter of course, got the priest of the parish, a good and pious man, to
      draw up a memorial in the name, as he said, of himself and his wife. The
      gentry of the neighborhood, also, including the members of the grand jury,
      addressed government on his behalf&mdash;for somehow there was created
      among those who knew the parties, or even who heard the history of their
      loves, a sympathy which resulted more from those generous impulses that
      intuitively perceive truth, than from the cooler calculations of reason.
      The heart never reasons&mdash;it is, therefore, the seat of feeling, and
      the fountain of mercy; the head does&mdash;and it is probably on that
      account the seat of justice, often of severity, and not unfrequently of
      cruelty and persecution, Connor himself was much relieved by that day&rsquo;s
      interview with his father. Even he could perceive a change for the better
      in the old man&rsquo;s deportment. Fardorougha&rsquo;s praises of Honor, and his
      strong allusions to the support and affection he experienced at her hands,
      under circumstances so trying, were indeed well calculated to prepare &ldquo;her
      noble boy,&rdquo; as she truly called him, for the reception of the still more
      noble message which she sent him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said he, as they separated that day, &ldquo;tell my mother that I will
      die as she wishes me; and tell her, too, that if I wasn&rsquo;t an innocent man,
      I could not do it. And oh, father,&rdquo; he added, and he seized his hands, and
      fell upon his neck, &ldquo;oh, father dear, if you love me, your own Connor&mdash;and
      I know you do&mdash;oh, then, father dear, I say again, be guided in this
      heavy affliction by my dear mother&rsquo;s advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor,&rdquo; returned the old man, deeply affected, &ldquo;I will. I had made my
      mind up to that afore I saw you at all to-day. Connor, do you know what
      I&rsquo;m beginning to think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, father dear, I do not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, it&rsquo;s this, that she&rsquo;ll be the manes of savin&rsquo; your father&rsquo;s
      soul. Connor, I can look back now upon my money&mdash;all I lost&mdash;it
      was no doubt terrible&mdash;terrible all out. Connor, my rint is due, and
      I haven&rsquo;t the manes of meetin&rsquo; it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alas! thought the boy, how hard it is to root altogether out of the heart
      that principle which inclines it to the love of wealth!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, I will take your advice, Connor, and be guided by your
      mother. She&rsquo;s very poorly, or she&rsquo;d be wid you afore now; but, indeed,
      Connor, her health is the occasion of it&mdash;it is&mdash;it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fardorougha&rsquo;s apology for his wife contained much more truth than he
      himself was aware of at the time he made it. On returning home that night
      he found her considerably worse, but, as she had been generally healthy,
      he very naturally ascribed her illness to the affliction she felt for the
      fate of their son. In this, however, he was mistaken, as the original
      cause of it was unconnected with the heavy domestic dispensation which had
      fallen upon them. So far as she was concerned, the fate of her boy would
      have called up from her heart fresh energy and&rsquo; if possible a higher order
      of meek but pious courage.&mdash;She would not have left him unsustained
      and uncherished, had the physical powers of the mother been able to second
      the sacred principles with which she met and triumphed over the trial that
      was laid upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one evening about ten days after O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s conviction that Bodagh
      Buie O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s wife sat by the bedside of her enfeebled and languishing
      daughter. The crisis of her complaint had passed the day before; and a
      very slight improvement, visible only to the eye of her physician, had
      taken place. Her delirium remained much as before; sometimes returning
      with considerable violence, and again leaving reason, though feeble and
      easily disturbed, yet when unexcited by external causes, capable of
      applying its powers to the circumstances around her. On this occasion the
      mother, who watched every motion and anticipated every wish of the beloved
      one, saw that she turned her eye several times upon her as if some
      peculiar anxiety distressed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Una, jewel,&rdquo; she at length inquired, &ldquo;is there anything you want, colleen
      maehree; or anything I can do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come near me, mother,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;come near me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her mother approached her still more nearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; she said, in a very low voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid to ask it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only wait for a minute or two,&rdquo; said her mother, &ldquo;an&rsquo; John will&mdash;but
      here&rsquo;s the doctor&rsquo;s foot; they wor spakin&rsquo; a word or two below; an&rsquo; 
      whisper, darlin&rsquo; o&rsquo; my heart, sure John has something to tell you&mdash;something
      that will&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked with a searching anxiety into her mother&rsquo;s face; and it might
      have been perceived that the morning twilight of hope beamed faintly but
      beautifully upon her pale features. The expression that passed over them
      was indeed so light and transient that one could scarcely say she smiled;
      yet that a more perceptible serenity diffused its gentle irradiation over
      her languid countenance was observed even by her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor&rsquo;s report was favorable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is slowly improving,&rdquo; he said, on reaching the parlor, &ldquo;since
      yesterday; I&rsquo;m afraid, however, she&rsquo;s too weak at present to sustain this
      intelligence. I would recommend you to wait for a day or two, and in the
      meantime to assume a cheerful deportment, and to break it to her rather by
      your looks and manner than by a direct or abrupt communication.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They promised to observe his directions; but when her mother informed them
      of the hint she herself threw out to her, they resolved to delay the
      matter no longer; and John, in consequence of what his mother had led her
      to expect, went to break the intelligence to her as well as he could. An
      expectation had been raised in her mind, and he judged properly enough
      that there was less danger in satisfying it than in leaving her just then
      in a state of such painful uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Una,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am glad to hear the doctor say that you are
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I am a little,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was my mother saying to you, just now, before the doctor was with
      you? But why do you look at me so keenly, Una?&rdquo; said he, cheerfully; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
      sometime since you saw me in such a good humor&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused for a moment herself; and her brother could observe that the
      hope which his manner was calculated to awaken, lit itself into a faiut
      smile rather visible in her eyes than on her features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I believe you are smiling yourself, Una.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John,&rdquo; said she, earnestly, &ldquo;is it good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, darling&mdash;he won&rsquo;t die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss me, kiss me,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;may eternal blessings rest upon you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then kissed him affectionately, laid her head back upon the pillow,
      and John saw with delight that the large tears of happiness rolled in
      torrents down her palo cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed true that Connor O&rsquo;Donovan was not to die. The memorials
      which had reached government from so many quarters, backed as they were by
      very powerful influence, and detailing as they did a case of such very
      romantic interest, could scarcely fail in arresting the execution of so
      stern and deadly a sentence. It was ascertained, too, by the intercourse
      of his friends with government, that the judge who tried his case,
      notwithstanding the apparent severity of his charge, had been moved by an
      irresistible impulse to save him, and he actually determined from the
      beginning to have his sentence commuted to transportation for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The happy effect of this communication on Una O&rsquo;Brien diffused a cheerful
      spirit among her family and relatives, who, in truth, had feared that her
      fate would ultimately depend upon that of her lover. After having been
      much relieved by the copious flood of tears she shed, and heard with
      composure all the details connected with the mitigation of his sentence,
      she asked her brother if Connor&rsquo;s parents had been yet made acquainted
      with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;the time is too short.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John,&rdquo; said the affectionate girl, &ldquo;oh, consider his mother; and think of
      the misery that one single hour&rsquo;s knowledge of this may take away from her
      heart! Go to her, my dear John, and may all the blessings of heaven rest
      upon you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good&mdash;by, then, Una dear; I will go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took her worn hand in his, as he spoke, and, looking on her with
      affectionate admiration, added&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! good-by, my darling sister; believe me, Una, that I think if there&rsquo;s
      justice in Heaven, you&rsquo;ll have a light heart yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very light now,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;compared with what it was; but go,
      John, don&rsquo;t lose a moment; for I know what they suffer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her mother, after John&rsquo;s departure for Fardorougha&rsquo;s, went up to sit with
      her; but she found that the previous scene, although it relieved, had
      exhausted her. In the course of a few minutes their limited dialogue
      ceased, and she sank into a sound and refreshing sleep, from which she did
      not awaken until her brother had some time returned from the execution of
      his pious message. And piously was that message received by her for whose
      misery the considerate heart of Una O&rsquo;Brien felt so deeply. Fardorougha
      had been out about the premises, mechanically looking to the manner in
      which the business of his farm had been of late managed by his two
      servants, when he descried O&rsquo;Brien approaching the house at a quick if not
      a hurried pace. He immediately went in and communicated the circumstance
      to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honor,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;here is Bodagh Buie&rsquo;s son comin&rsquo; up to the house&mdash;what
      on earth can bring the boy here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the first day on which his wife had been able to rise from her
      sick bed. She was consequently feeble, and, physically speaking, capable
      of no domestic exertion. Her mind, however, was firm as ever, and prompt
      as before her calamity to direct and overlook, in her own sweet and
      affectionate manner, whatever required her superintendence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know, Fardorougha,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t, I hope, be
      wid bad news&mdash;they thravel fast enough&mdash;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m sure the
      Bodagh&rsquo;s son wouldn&rsquo;t take pleasure in bein&rsquo; the first to tell them to
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what can bring him, Honor? What on earth can bring the boy here now,
      that never stood undher our roof afore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three or four minutes, Fardorougha, will tell us. Let us hope in God it
      isn&rsquo;t bad. Eh, Saver above, it wouldn&rsquo;t be the death of his sister&mdash;of
      Connor&rsquo;s Oona! No,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;they wouldn&rsquo;t send, much less come, to
      tell vis that; but sure we&rsquo;ll hear it&mdash;we&rsquo;ll hear it; and may God
      give us stringth to hear it right, whether it&rsquo;s good or bad! Amin, Jasus,
      this day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had hardly uttered the last words, when O&rsquo;Brien entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said this superior woman, &lsquo;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s a poor welcome we can give
      you to a house of sorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Fardorougha, &ldquo;his mother an&rsquo; I&rsquo;s here, but where is he? Nine
      days from this; but it &lsquo;ill kill me&mdash;it will&mdash;it will. Whin he&rsquo;s
      taken from me, I don&rsquo;t care how soon I folly him; God forgive me if it&rsquo;s a
      sin to say so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fardorougha,&rdquo; said his wife, in a tone of affectionate reproof, &ldquo;remember
      what you promised me, an&rsquo;, at all evints, you forget that Mr. O&rsquo;Brien here
      may have his own troubles; I heard your sister was unwell. Oh, how is she,
      poor thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, a great deal better; I will not deny but she heard a piece
      of intelligence this day, that has relieved her mind and taken a dead
      weight off her heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Honor, with uncommon firmness and solemnity of manner, placed her hand
      upon his shoulder, and, looking him earnestly in the face, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That news is about our son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; replied O&rsquo;Brien, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s good; his sentence is changed, and he
      is not to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to die!&rdquo; shrieked the old man, starting up, and clapping his hands
      frantically&mdash;&ldquo;not to die! our son&mdash;Connor, Connor&mdash;not to
      be hanged&mdash;not to be hanged! Did you say that, son of O&rsquo;Brien Buie,
      did you&mdash;did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; replied the other; &ldquo;he will not suffer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s God,&rdquo; ejaculated Fardorougha, wildly; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s God an&rsquo; his
      mother&rsquo;s prayers. Boys,&rdquo; he shrieked, &ldquo;come here; come here, Biddy Nulty,
      come her; Connor&rsquo;s not to die; he won&rsquo;t suffer&mdash;he won&rsquo;t suffer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was rushing wildly to the door, but Honor placed herself before him,
      and said, in that voice of calmness which is uniformly that of authority
      and power:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fardorougha, dear, calm yourself. If this is God&rsquo;s work, as you say, why
      not resave it as comm&rsquo; from God? It&rsquo;s upon your two knees you ought to
      drop, an&rsquo;&mdash;Saver above, what&rsquo;s the matther wid him? He&rsquo;s off; keep
      him up. Oh, God bless you! that&rsquo;s it, avourneen; jist place him on the
      chair there fornext the door, where he can have air. Here, dear,&rdquo; said she
      to Biddy Nulty, who, on hearing herself called by her master, had come in
      from another room; &ldquo;get some feathers, Biddy, till we burn them undher his
      nose; but first fetch a jug of cold water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On looking at the face of the miser, O&rsquo;Brien started, as indeed well he
      might, at such a pallid, worn, and death&mdash;like countenance; why,
      thought he to himself, surely this must be death, and the old man&rsquo;s cares,
      and sorrows, and hopes, are all passed forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honor now bathed his face, and wet his lips with water, and as she
      sprinkled and rubbed back the gray hair from his emaciate! temples, there
      might be read there an expression of singular wildness that resembles the
      wreck produced by insanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks ill,&rdquo; observed O&rsquo;Brien, who actually thought him dead; &ldquo;but I
      hope it won&rsquo;t signify.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust in God&rsquo;s mercy it won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Honor; &ldquo;for till his heart,
      poor man, is brought more to God&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused with untaught delicacy, for she reflected that he was her
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For that matther, who is there,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;that is fit to go to
      their last account at a moment&rsquo;s warnin&rsquo;? That&rsquo;s a good girl, Biddy; give
      me the feathers; there&rsquo;s nothing like them. Dheah Gratihias! Dheah
      Gratihias!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s not&mdash;he&rsquo;s not&mdash;an&rsquo; I was afeard
      he was&mdash;no, he&rsquo;s recoverin&rsquo;. Shake him; rouse him a little;
      Fardorougha, dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&mdash;where am I?&rdquo; exclaimed her husband; &ldquo;what is this? what ails
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then looked inquiringly at his wife and O&rsquo;Brien; but it appeared that
      the presence of the latter revived in his mind the cause of his
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it&mdash;is it thrue, young man? tell me&mdash;tell me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, dear, can any one have spirits to tell you good news, when you can&rsquo;t
      bear it aither like a man or a Christian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good news! You say, then, it&rsquo;s thrue, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s not to be hanged by the
      neck, as the judge said; an&rsquo; my curse&mdash;my heavy curse upon him for a
      judge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate to hear the words of his sentence, Fardorougha,&rdquo; said the wife;
      &ldquo;but if you have patience you&rsquo;ll find that his life&rsquo;s granted to him; an&rsquo;,
      for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, curse nobody. The judge only did his duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he exclaimed, sinking upon his knees, &ldquo;now, from this day out, let
      what will happen, I&rsquo;ll stick to my duty to God&mdash;I&rsquo;ll repent&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      repent and lead a new life. I will, an&rsquo; while I&rsquo;m alive I&rsquo;ll never say a
      word against the will of my heavenly Saviour; never, never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fardorougha,&rdquo; replied his&mdash;wife, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s good, no doubt, to have a
      grateful heart to God; but I&rsquo;m afeard there&rsquo;s sin in what you&rsquo;re sayin&rsquo;,
      for you know, dear, that, whether it plased the Almighty to take yur boy,
      or not, what you&rsquo;ve promised to do is your duty. It&rsquo;s like sayin&rsquo;, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
      now turn my heart bekase God has deserved it at my hands.&rsquo; Still, dear,
      I&rsquo;m not goin&rsquo; to condimn you, only I think it&rsquo;s betther an&rsquo; safer to love
      an&rsquo; obey God for His own sake! blessed be His holy name!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young O&rsquo;Brien was forcibly struck by the uncommon character of Honor
      O&rsquo;Donovan. Her patience, good sense, and sincere acquiescence in the will
      of God, under so severe a trial, were such as he had never seen: equalled.
      Nor could he help admitting to himself, while contemplating her conduct,
      that the example of such a woman was not only the most beautiful comment
      on religious truth, but the noblest testimony of its power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Honor,&rdquo; said the husband, in reply, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re right, for I know that
      what you say is always thrue. It is, indeed,&rdquo; he added, addressing
      O&rsquo;Brien, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s aquil to a prayer-book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and far superior to any,&rdquo; replied the latter; &ldquo;for she not only
      gives you the advice, but sets you the example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, the sorra lie in it; an&rsquo;, oh, Honor, he&rsquo;s not to die&mdash;he&rsquo;s not
      to be h&mdash;&mdash;, not to suffer. Our son&rsquo;s to live! Oh, Saver of
      earth, make me thankful this day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tears ran fast from his eyes as he looked up to heaven, and uttered,
      the last; words. Indeed, it was impossible not to feel deep compassion for
      this aged man, whose heart had been smitten so heavily, and on the only
      two points where it was capable of feeling the blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      After having indulged his grief for some time, he became considerably more
      composed, if not cheerful. Honor made many kind inquiries after Una&rsquo;s
      health, to which her brother answered with strict candor, for he had heard
      from Una that she was acquainted with the whole history of their
      courtship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows,&rdquo; said she, speaking with reference to their melancholy fate,
      &ldquo;but the God who has saved his life, an&rsquo; most likely hers, may yet do more
      for them both? While there&rsquo;s life there&rsquo;s hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said Fardorougha, &ldquo;you carry a blessin&rsquo; wid you wherever you
      go, an&rsquo; may God bless you for the news you have brought to us this day!
      I&rsquo;ll go to see him tomorrow, an&rsquo; wid a light heart I&rsquo;ll go too, for my son
      is not to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      O&rsquo;Brien then took his leave and returned home, pondering, as he went, upon
      the singular contrast which existed between the character of the miser and
      that of his admirable wife. He was no sooner gone than Honor addressed her
      husband as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fardorougha, what do you think we ought both to do now afther the happy
      news we&rsquo;ve heard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be guided by you, Honor; I&rsquo;ll be guided by you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;go an&rsquo; thank God that has taken the edge, the bitther,
      keen edge off of our sufferin&rsquo;; an&rsquo; the best way, in my opinion, for you
      to do it, is to go to the barn by yourself, an&rsquo; strive to put your whole
      heart into your prayers. You&rsquo;ll pray betther by yourself than wid me. An&rsquo; 
      in the name of God I&rsquo;ll do the same as well as I can in the house here.
      To-morrow, too, is Friday, an&rsquo;, plaise our Saviour, we&rsquo;ll both fast in
      honor of His goodness to us an&rsquo; to our son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will, Honor,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we will, indeed; for now I have spirits to
      fast, and spirits to pray, too. What will I say, now? Will I say the five
      Decades or the whole Rosary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can keep your mind in the prayers, I think you ought to say the
      whole of it; but if you wandher don&rsquo;t say more than the five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fardorougha then went to the bam, rather because his wife desired him,
      than from a higher motive, whilst she withdrew to her own apartment, there
      humbly to worship God in thanksgiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day had made the commutation of Connor&rsquo;s punishment a matter of
      notoriety through the whole parish, and very sincere indeed was the
      gratification it conveyed to all who heard it. Public fame, it is true,
      took her usual liberties with the facts. Some said he had got a free
      pardon, others that he was to be liberated after six months&rsquo; imprisonment;
      and a third report asserted that the lord lieutenant sent him down a
      hundred pounds to fit him out for marriage with Una; and it further added
      that his excellency wrote a letter with his own hand, to Bodagh Buie,
      desiring him to give his daughter to Connor on receipt of it, or if not,
      that the Knight of the Black Rod would come down, strip him of his
      property, and bestow it upon Connor and his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man himself was almost one of the first who heard of this
      favorable change in his dreadful sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was seated on his bedside reading, when the sheriff and jailer entered
      his cell, anxious to lay before him the reply which had that morning
      arrived from government.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m inclined to think, O&rsquo;Donovan, that your case is likely to turn out
      more favorably than we expected,&rdquo; said the humane sheriff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, with all my heart, it may,&rdquo; replied the other; &ldquo;there is no
      denying, sir, that I&rsquo;d wish it. Life is sweet, especially to a young man
      of my years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if we should fail,&rdquo; observed the jailer, &ldquo;I trust you will act the
      part of a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, at all events, that I will act the part of a Christian,&rdquo; returned
      O&rsquo;Donovan. &ldquo;I certainly would rather live; but I&rsquo;m not afeard of death,
      and if it comes, I trust I will meet it humbly but firmly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; said the sheriff, &ldquo;you need entertain little apprehension of
      death; I&rsquo;m inclined to think that that part of your sentence is not likely
      to be put in execution. I have heard as much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, sir, by your manner, that you have,&rdquo; returned Connor; &ldquo;but I beg
      you to tell me without goin&rsquo; about. Don&rsquo;t be afeared, sir, that I&rsquo;m too
      wake to hear either good news or bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sheriff made no reply; but placed in his hands the official document
      which remitted to him the awful penalty of his life. Connor read it over
      slowly, and the other kept his eye fixed keenly upon his countenance, in
      order to observe his bearing under circumstances that are often known to
      test human fortitude as severely as death itself. He could, however,
      perceive no change; not even the unsteadiness of a nerve or muscle was
      visible, nor the slightest fluctuation in the hue of his complexion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel grateful to the lord lieutenant for his mercy to me,&rdquo; said he,
      handing him back the letter, &ldquo;as I do to the friends who interceded for
      me; I never will or can forget their goodness. Oh, never, never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it,&rdquo; said the sheriff; &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s one thing that I&rsquo;m anxious
      to press upon your attention; and it&rsquo;s this, that no further mitigation of
      your punishment is to be expected from government; so that you must make
      up your mind to leave your friends and your country for life, as you know
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect nothing more,&rdquo; returned Connor, &ldquo;except this, that the hand of
      God may yet bring the guilt of burning home to the man that committed it,
      and prove my innocence. I&rsquo;m <i>now</i> not without some hope that such a
      thing may be brought about some how. I thank you, Misther Sheriff, for
      your kindness in coming to me with this good news so soon; all that I can
      say is, that I thank you from my heart. I am bound to say, too, that any
      civility and comfort that could be shown was afforded me ever since I came
      here, an&rsquo; I feel it, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m grateful for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both were deeply impressed by the firm tone of manly sincerity and
      earnestness with which he spoke, blended as it was by a melancholy which
      gave, at the same time, a character of elevation and pathos to all he
      said. They then shook hands with him, after chatting for some time on
      indifferent subjects, the jailer promising to make his situation while he
      should remain in prison as easy as the regulations would allow him or,
      &ldquo;who knows,&rdquo; he added, smiling, &ldquo;but we might make them a little easier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine young fellow,&rdquo; said he to the sheriff, after they had left
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a gentleman,&rdquo; replied the sherif &ldquo;by nature a gentleman; and a very
      uncommon one, too. I defy a man to doubt word that comes out of his lips;
      all he says is impressed with the stamp of truth itself and by h&mdash;&mdash;n&rsquo;s
      he never committed the felony he&rsquo;s in for! Keep him as comfortable as you
      can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They then separated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The love of life is the first and strong principle in our nature, and what
      man is there except some unhappy wretch pressed down by long and galling
      misery to the uttermost depths of despair, who, knows that life was
      forfeited, whether justly or it matters little, to the laws of his country
      will not feel the mercy which bids him live with a corresponding sense of
      gratitude. The son of the pious mother acted, as if she was still his
      guide and monitress.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knelt down and poured out his gratitude to that great Being who had the
      final claim upon it, and whose blessing he fervently invoked upon the
      heads of those true friends by whose exertions and influence he knew that
      life was restored to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of his life while he remained in this country there is little more to be
      said than what is usually known to occur in the case of of convicts
      similarly circumstanced, if we exclude his separation from the few persons
      who were dear to him. He saw his father the next day and the old man felt
      almost disappointed discovering that he was deprived of the pleasure which
      he proposed to himself of be the bearer of such glad tidings to him. Those
      who visited him, however, noticed with a good deal of surprise, that he
      appeared as laboring under some secret aim which, however, no tact or
      address on their part could induce him to disclose. Many of them, actuated
      by the best motives, asked him in distinct terms why he appeared to be
      troubled; but the only reply they received was a good-humored remark that
      it was not to be expected that he could leave forever all that was dear to
      him on earth with a very cheerful spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this period that his old friend Nogher M&rsquo;Cormick came to pay him
      a visit; it being the last time, as he said, that he would ever have an
      opportunity of seeing his face. Nogher, whose moral impressions were by no
      means so correct as Connor&rsquo;s, asked him, with a face of dry, peculiar
      mystery, if he had any particular wish unfulfilled; or if there remained
      behind him any individual against whom he entertained a spirit of enmity.
      If there were he begged him to make no scruple in entrusting to him a full
      statement of his wishes on the subject, adding that he might rest assured
      of having them accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing you may be certain of, Nogher,&rdquo; said he, to the affectionate
      fellow, &ldquo;that I have no secrets to tell; so don&rsquo;t let that go abroad upon
      me. I have heard to-day,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that the vessel we are to go in will
      sail on this day week. My father was here this mornin&rsquo;; but I hadn&rsquo;t heard
      it then. Will you, Nogher, tell my mother privately that she mustn&rsquo;t come
      to see me on the day I appointed with my father? From the state of health
      she&rsquo;s in, I&rsquo;m tould she couldn&rsquo;t bear it. Tell her, then, not to come till
      the day before I sail; an&rsquo; that I will expect to see her early on that
      day. And, Nogher, as you know more about this unhappy business than any
      one else, except the O&rsquo;Briens and ourselves, will you give this little
      packet to my mother? There&rsquo;s three or four locks of my hair in it; one of
      them is for Una; and desire my mother to see Una, and to get a link of her
      hair to wear next my heart. My poor father&mdash;now that he finds he must
      part with me&mdash;is so distracted and distressed, that I couldn&rsquo;t trust
      him with this message. I want it to be kept a secret to every one but you,
      my mother, and Una; but my poor father would he apt to mention it in some
      fit of grief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is there nothing else on your mind, Connor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no heavy guilt on my mind, Nogher, I thank my God and my dear
      mother for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I can tell you one thing before you go, Connor&mdash;Bartle
      Flanagan&rsquo;s well watched. If he has been guilty&mdash;if&mdash;derry downs,
      who doubts it&rsquo;?&mdash;well never mind; I&rsquo;ll hould a trifle we get him to
      show the cloven foot, and condemn himself yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The villain,&rdquo; said Connor, &ldquo;will be too deep&mdash;too polished for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten to one he&rsquo;s not. Do you know what we&rsquo;ve found out since this
      business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the divil resave the squig of punch, whiskey, or liquor of any sort
      or size he&rsquo;ll allow to pass the lips of him. Now, Connor, aren&rsquo;t you up to
      the cunnin&rsquo; villainy of the thraitor in that maynewvre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, Nogher; I see his design in it. He is afeard if he got drunk that
      he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to keep his own secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, then, by the holy Nelly, we&rsquo;ll sleep him yet, or he&rsquo;ll look sharp.
      Never you mind him, Connor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nogher! stop,&rdquo; said Connor, almost angrily, &ldquo;stop; what do you mane by
      them last words?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divil a much; it&rsquo;s about the blaggard I&rsquo;m spakin&rsquo;; he&rsquo;ll be ped, I can
      tell you. There&rsquo;s a few friends of yours that intinds, some o&rsquo; these
      nights, to open a gusset under one of his ears only; the divil a thing
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! to take the unhappy man&rsquo;s life&mdash;to murdher him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hut, Connor; who&rsquo;s spakin&rsquo; about murdher? No, only to make him miss his
      breath some night afore long. Does he desarve mercy that &lsquo;ud swear away
      the life of an innocent man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nogher,&rdquo; replied the other, rising up and speaking with the utmost
      solemnity&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If one drop of his blood is spilt on my account, it will bring the
      vengeance of Heaven upon the head of every man havin&rsquo; a hand in it. Will
      you, because he&rsquo;s a villain, make yourself murdherers&mdash;make
      yourselves blacker than he is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wiry, thin, death alive! Connor, have you your seven sinsis about you?
      Faith, that&rsquo;s good; as if it was a sin to knock such a white-livered Judas
      upon the head! Sin!&mdash;oh hell resave the morsel o&rsquo; sin in that but the
      contrairy. Sure its only sarvin&rsquo; honest people right, to knock such a
      desaiver on the head. If he had parjured himself for sake of the truth, or
      to assist a brother in trouble&mdash;or to help on the good cause&mdash;it
      would be something; but to go to&mdash;but&mdash;arra, be me sowl, he&rsquo;ll
      sup sarra for it, sure enough! I thought it would make your mind aisy, or
      I wouldn&rsquo;t mintion it till we&rsquo;d let the breath out of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nogher,&rdquo; said Connor, &ldquo;before you leave this unfortunate room, you must
      take the Almighty to witness that you&rsquo;ll have no hand in this bloody
      business, an&rsquo; that you&rsquo;ll put a stop to it altogether. If you don&rsquo;t, and
      that his life is taken, in the first place, I&rsquo;ll be miserable for life;
      and in the next, take my word for it, that the judgment of God will fall
      heavily upon every one consarned in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for? Is it for slittin&rsquo; the juggler of sich a rip? Isn&rsquo;t he as bad
      as a heretic, an&rsquo; worse, for he turned against his own. He has got himself
      made the head of a lodge, too, and holds Articles; but it&rsquo;s not bein&rsquo; an
      Article-bearer that&rsquo;ll save him, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll find that to his cost. But,
      indeed, Connor, the villain&rsquo;s a double thraitor, as you&rsquo;d own, if you knew
      what I heard a hint of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but you must lave him to God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think but I got a whisper that he has bad designs on her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On who?&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Donovan (starting).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, on your own girl, Oona, the Bodagh&rsquo;s daughter. He intends, it&rsquo;s
      whispered, to take her off; an&rsquo; it seems, as her father doesn&rsquo;t stand well
      with the boys, that Bartle&rsquo;s to get a great body of them to assist him in
      bringing her away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connor paced his cell in deep and vehement agitation. His resentment
      against this double-dyed villain rose to a fearful pitch; his color
      deepened-his eye shot fire, and, as he clenched his hand convulsively,
      Nogher saw the fury which this intelligence had excited in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he proceeded, &ldquo;it would be an open sin an&rsquo; shame to let such an
      etarnal limb of the devil escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It may, indeed, be said that O&rsquo;Donovan never properly felt the sense of
      his restraint until this moment. When he reflected on the danger to which
      his beloved Una was exposed from the dark plans of this detestable
      villain, and recollected that there existed in the members of the illegal
      confederacy such a strong spirit of enmity against Bodagh Buie, as would
      induce them to support Bartle in his designs upon his daughter, he pressed
      his hand against his forehead, and walked about in a tumult of distress
      and resentment, such as he had never yet felt in his bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a charity it will be,&rdquo; said Nogher, shrewdly availing himself of the
      commotion he had created, &ldquo;to stop the vagabone short in the coorse of his
      villany. He&rsquo;ll surely bring the darlin&rsquo; young girl off, an&rsquo; destroy her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments he felt as if his heart were disposed to rebel against
      the common ordinances of Providence, as they appeared to be manifested in
      his own punishment, and the successful villainy of Bartle Flanagan. The
      reflection, however, of a strong and naturally pious mind soon enabled him
      to perceive the errors into which his passions would lead him, if not
      restrained and subjected. He made an effort to be calm, and in a
      considerable degree succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nogher,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let us not forget that this Bartle&mdash;this&mdash;but
      I will not say it&mdash;let us not forget that God can asily turn his
      plans against himself. To God, then, let us lave him. Now, hear me&mdash;you
      must swear in His presence that you will have neither act nor part in
      doing him an injury&mdash;that you will not shed his blood, nor allow it
      to be shed by others, as far as you can prevent it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nogher rubbed his chin gravely, and almost smiled at what he considered to
      be a piece of silly nonsense on the part of Connor. He determined,
      therefore, to satisfy his scruples as well as he could; but, let the
      consequence be what it might, to evade such an oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Connor,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;surely, if you go to that, we can have no
      ill-will against the d&mdash;n villain; an&rsquo; as you don&rsquo;t wish it, we&rsquo;ll
      dhrop&mdash;the thing; so now make your mind aisy, for another word you or
      any one else won&rsquo;t ever hear about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you won&rsquo;t injure the man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hut! no,&rdquo; replied Nogher, with a gravity whose irony was barely
      perceptible, &ldquo;what would we murdher him for, now that you don&rsquo;t wish it? I
      never had any particular wish to see my own funeral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, Nogher, you will do all you can to prevent him from being
      murdhered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure, Connor&mdash;to be sure. By He that made me, we won&rsquo;t give
      pain to a single hair of his head. Are you satisfied now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; replied the ingenuous young man, who was himself too candid to see
      through the sophistry of Nogher&rsquo;s oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Nogher,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;many a day have we spent together&mdash;you
      are one of my oldest friends. I suppose this is the last time you will
      ever see Connor O.&lsquo;Donovan; however, don&rsquo;t, man&mdash;don&rsquo;t be cast down;
      you will hear from me, I hope, and hear that I am well too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He uttered this with a smile which cost him an effort; for, on looking
      into the face of his faithful old friend, he saw his muscles working under
      the influence of strong feeling&mdash;or, I should rather say, deep sorrow&mdash;which
      he felt anxious, by a show of cheerfulness, to remove. The fountains,
      however, of the old servant&rsquo;s heart were opened, and, after some
      ineffectual attempts to repress his grief, he fell upon Connor&rsquo;s neck, and
      wept aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, Nogher,&rdquo; said Connor, &ldquo;surely it&rsquo;s&mdash;glad you ought to be,
      instead of sorry. What would you have done if my first sentence had been
      acted upon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad for your sake,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m now sorry for my
      own. You will live, Connor, and you may yet be happy; but he that often
      held you in his arms&mdash;that often played with you, and that, next to
      your father and mother, you loved betther than any other livin&rsquo;&mdash;he,
      poor Nogher, will never see his boy more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On uttering these words, he threw himself again upon Connor&rsquo;s neck, and we
      are not ashamed to say that their tears flowed together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll miss you, Connor, dear; I&rsquo;ll not see your face at fair or market,
      nor on the chapel&mdash;green of a Sunday. Your poor father will break his
      heart, and the mother&rsquo;s eye will never more have an opportunity of being
      proud out of her son. It&rsquo;s hard upon me to part wid you, Connor, but it
      can&rsquo;t be helped; I only ax you to remember Nogher, that, you know, loved
      you as if you wor his own; remimber me, Connor, of an odd time. I never
      thought&mdash;oh, Grod, I never thought to see this day! No wondher&mdash;oh,
      no wondher that the fair young crature should be pale and worn, an&rsquo; sick
      at heart! I love her now, an&rsquo; ever will, as well as I did yourself. I&rsquo;ll
      never see her, Connor, widout thinkin&rsquo; heavily of him that her heart was
      set upon, an&rsquo; that will then be far away from her an&rsquo; from all that ever
      loved him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nogher,&rdquo; replied Connor, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not without hope that&mdash;but this&mdash;this
      is folly. You know I have a right to be thankful to God and the goodness
      of government for sparin&rsquo; my life. Now, farewell&mdash;it is forever,
      Nogher, an&rsquo; it is a tryin&rsquo; word to-day; but you know that every one goin&rsquo; 
      to America must say it; so, think that I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; there, an&rsquo; it won&rsquo;t
      signify.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Connor, I wish I could,&rdquo; replied Nogher; &ldquo;but, to tell the truth,
      what breaks my heart is, to think of the way you are goin&rsquo; from us.
      Farewell, then, Connor darlin; an&rsquo; may the blessin&rsquo; of God, an&rsquo; His holy
      mother, an&rsquo; of all the saints be upon you now an&rsquo; foriver. Amin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His tears flowed fast, and he sobbed aloud, whilst uttering the last
      words; he then threw his arms about Connor&rsquo;s neck, and, having kissed him,
      he again wrung his hand, and passed out of the cell in an agony of grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is the anomalous nature of that peculiar temperament, which, in
      Ireland, combines within it the extremes of generosity and crime. Here was
      a man who had been literally affectionate and harmless during his whole
      past life, yet, who was now actually plotting the murder of a person who
      had never,&mdash;except remotely, by his treachery to Connor, whom he
      loved&mdash;rendered him an injury, or given him any cause of offence. And
      what can show us the degraded state of moral feeling among a people whose
      natural impulses are as quick to virtue as to vice, and the reckless
      estimate which the peasantry form of human life, more clearly than the
      fact, that Connor, the noble&mdash;minded, heroic, and pious peasant,
      could admire the honest attachment of hia old friend, without dwelling
      upon the dark point in his character, and mingle his tears with a man who
      was deliberately about to join in, or encompass, the assassination of a
      fellow-creature!
    </p>
    <p>
      Even against persons of his own creed the Irishman thinks that revenge is
      a duty which he owes to himself;&mdash;but against those of a different
      faith it is not only a duty but a virtue&mdash;and any man who acts out of
      this feeling, either as a juror, a witness, or an elector&mdash;for the
      principle is the same&mdash;must expect to meet such retribution as was
      suggested by a heart like Nogher M&rsquo;Cormick&rsquo;s, which was otherwise
      affectionate and honest. In the secret code of perverted honor by which
      Irishmen are guided, he is undoubtedly the most heroic and manly, and the
      most worthy also of imitation, who indulges in, and executes his vengeance
      for injuries whether real or supposed, with the most determined and
      unshrinking spirit; but the man who is capable of braving death, by
      quoting his own innocence as an argument against the justice of law, even
      when notoriously guilty, is looked upon by the people, not as an innocent
      man&mdash;for his accomplices and friends know he is not&mdash;but as one
      who is a hero in his rank of life; and it is unfortunately a kind of
      ambition among too many of our ill-thinking but generous countrymen, to
      propose such men as the best models for imitation, not only in their
      lives, but in that hardened hypocrisy which defies and triumphs over the
      ordeal of death itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connor O&rsquo;Donovan was a happy representation of all that is noble and pious
      in the Irish character, without one tinge of the crimes which darken or
      discolor it. But the heart that is full of generosity and fortitude, is
      generally most susceptible of the kinder and more amiable affections. The
      noble boy, who could hear the sentence of death without the commotion of a
      nerve, was forced to weep on the neck of an old and faithful follower who
      loved him, when he remembered that, after that melancholy visit, he should
      see his familiar face no more. When Nogher left him, a train of painful
      reflections passed through his mind. He thought of Una, of his father, of
      his mother, and for some time was more depressed than usual. But the gift
      of life to the young is ever a counterbalance to every evil that is less
      than death. In a short time he reflected that the same Providence which
      had interposed between him and his recorded sentence, had his future fate
      in its hands; and that he had health, and youth, and strength&mdash;and,
      above all, a good conscience&mdash;to bear him through the future
      vicissitudes of his appointed fate.

    <h2>
      PART VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      To those whose minds and bodies are of active habits, there can be
      scarcely anything more trying than a position in which the latter is
      deprived of its usual occupation, and the former forced to engage itself
      only on the contemplation of that which is painful. In such a situation,
      the mental and physical powers are rendered incapable of mutually
      sustaining each other; for we all know that mere corporal employment
      lessens affliction, or enables us in a shorter time to forget it, whilst
      the acuteness of bodily suffering, on the other hand, is blunted by those
      pursuits which fill the mind with agreeable impressions. During the few
      days, therefore, that intervened between the last interview which Connor
      held with Nogher M&rsquo;Cormick, and the day of his final departure he felt
      himself rather relieved than depressed by the number of friends who came
      to visit him for the last time. He was left less to solitude and himself
      than he otherwise would have been, and, of course, the days of his
      imprisonment were neither so dreary nor oppressive as the uninterrupted
      contemplation of his gloomy destiny would have rendered them. Full of the
      irrepressible ardor of youth, he longed for that change which he knew must
      bring him onward in the path of life; and in this how little did he
      resemble the generality of other convicts, who feel as if time were
      bringing about the day of their departure with painful and more than
      ordinary celerity! At length the interviews between him and all those whom
      he wished to see were concluded, with the exception of three, viz.&mdash;John
      O&rsquo;Brien and his own parents, whilst only two clear days intervened until
      the period, of his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the third morning previous to that unhappy event, that the
      brother of his Una&mdash;the most active and indefatigable of all those
      who had interested themselves for him&mdash;was announced as requiring an
      interview. Connor, although prepared for this, experienced on the
      occasion, as every high-minded person would do, a strong feeling of
      degradation and shame as the predominant sensation. That, indeed, was but
      natural, for it is undoubtedly true that we feel disgrace the more heavily
      upon us in the eyes of those we esteem, than we do under any other
      circumstances. This impression, however, though as we have said the
      strongest,&mdash;was far from being the only one he felt. A heart like his
      could not be insensible to the obligations under which the generous and
      indefatigable exertions of young O&rsquo;Brien had placed him. But,
      independently of this, he was Una&rsquo;s brother, and the appearance of one so
      dear to her gave to all his love for her a character of melancholy
      tenderness, more deep and full than he had probably ever experienced
      before. Her brother would have been received with extraordinary warmth on
      his own account, but, in addition to that, Connor knew that he now came on
      behalf of Una herself. It was, therefore, under a tumult of mingled
      sensations, that he received him in his gloomy apartment&mdash;gloomy in
      despite of all that a humane jailer could do to lessen the rigors of his
      confinement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot welcome you to sich a place, as this is,&rdquo; said Connor, grasping
      and wringing his hand, as the other entered, &ldquo;although I may well say that
      I would be glad to see you anywhere, as I am, indeed, to see you even
      here. I know what I owe you, an&rsquo; what you have done for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God,&rdquo; replied the other, returning his grasp with equal pressure,
      &ldquo;thank God, that, at all events, the worst of what we expected will not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       He paused, for, on looking at O&rsquo;Donovan, he observed upon his open brow a
      singular depth of melancholy, mingled less with an expression of shame,
      than with the calm but indignant sorrow of one who could feel no
      resentment against him with whom he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      O&rsquo;Brien saw, at a glance, that Connor, in consequence of something in his
      manner, joined to his inconsiderate congratulations, imagined that he
      believed him guilty. He lost not a moment, therefore, in correcting this
      mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been dreadful,&rdquo; he proceeded, &ldquo;to see innocent blood shed,
      through the perjury of a villain&mdash;for, of course, you cannot suppose
      for a moment that one of our family suppose you to be guilty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was near doin&rsquo; you injustice, then,&rdquo; replied the other; &ldquo;but I ought to
      know that if you did think me so, you wouldn&rsquo;t now be here, nor act as you
      did. Not but that I thought it possible, on another account you&mdash;&mdash;No,&rdquo;
       he added, after a pause, &ldquo;that would be doin&rsquo; the brother of Una
      injustice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; returned O&rsquo;Brien. &ldquo;No circumstance of any kind&rdquo;&mdash;and
      he laid a peculiar emphasis on the words&mdash;&ldquo;no circumstance of any
      kind could bring me to visit a man capable of such a mean and cowardly
      act; for, as to the loss we sustained, I wouldn&rsquo;t think of it. You, Connor
      O&rsquo;Donovan, are not the man to commit any act, either the one or the other.
      If I did not feel this, you would not see me before you.&rdquo; He extended his
      hand to him while he spoke, and the brow of Connor brightened as he met
      his grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;and now I hope we may spake out like men
      that undherstand one another. In case you hadn&rsquo;t come, I intended to lave
      a message for you with my mother. I believe you know all Una&rsquo;s secrets?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; replied O&rsquo;Brien, &ldquo;just as well as her confessor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I believe that,&rdquo; said Connor. &ldquo;The sun in heaven is not purer than
      she is. The only fault she ever could be charged with was her love for me;
      and heavily, oh! far too heavily, has she suffered for it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, for one, never blamed her on that account,&rdquo; said her brother. &ldquo;I knew
      that her good sense would have at any time prevented her from forming an
      attachment to an unworthy object; and upon the strength of her own
      judgment, I approved of that which she avowed for you. Indeed, I perceived
      it myself before she told me; but upon attempting to gain her secret, the
      candid creature at once made me her confidant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is like her,&rdquo; said Connor; &ldquo;she is all truth. Well would it be for
      her, if she had never seen me. Not even the parting from my father and
      mother sinks my heart with so much sorrow, as the thought that her love
      for me had made her so unhappy. It&rsquo;s a strange case, John O&rsquo;Brien, an&rsquo; a
      trying one; but since it is the will of God, we must submit to it. How did
      you leave her? I heard she was getting better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is better,&rdquo; said John&mdash;&ldquo;past danger, but still very delicate and
      feeble. Indeed, she is so much worn down, that you would scarcely know
      her. The brightness of her dark eye is dead&mdash;her complexion gone.
      Sorrow, as she says herself, is in her and upon her. Never, indeed, was a
      young creature&rsquo;s love so pure and true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      O&rsquo;Donovan made no reply for some time; but the other observed that he
      turned away his face from him, as if to conceal his emotion. At length his
      bosom heaved vehemently, three or four times, and his breath came and went
      with a quick and quivering motion, that betrayed the powerful struggle
      which he felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it is but natural for you to feel deeply,&rdquo; continued her brother;
      &ldquo;but as you have borne everything heretofore with so much firmness, you
      must not break down&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know it is a deadly thrial to be forever separated from sich a
      girl. Sufferin&rsquo; so much as you say&mdash;so worn! Her dark eye dim with&mdash;oh,
      it is, it is a deadly thrial&mdash;a heart&mdash;breaking thrial! John
      O&rsquo;Brien,&rdquo; he proceeded, with uncommon earnestness, &ldquo;you are her only
      brother, an&rsquo; she is your only sister. Oh, will you, for the sake of God,
      and for my sake, if I may take the liberty of sayin&rsquo; so&mdash;but, above
      all things, will you, for her own sake, when I am gone, comfort and
      support her, and raise her heart, if possible, out of this heavy
      throuble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her brother gazed on him with a melancholy smile, in which might be read
      both admiration and sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it possible that I would, or could omit to cherish and
      sustain poor Una, under such thrying circumstances! Everything considered,
      however, your words are only natural&mdash;only natural.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let her think too much about it,&rdquo; continued O&rsquo;Donovan. &ldquo;Bring her
      out as much as you can&mdash;let her not be much by herself. But this is
      folly in me,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;you know yourself better than I can instruct you
      how to act.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows,&rdquo; replied the brother, struck and softened by the mournful
      anxiety for her welfare which Connor expressed, &ldquo;God knows that all you
      say, and all I can think of besides, shall be done for our dear girl&mdash;so
      make your mind easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; replied the other; &ldquo;from my soul an&rsquo; from the bottom of my
      heart, I thank you. Endeavor to make her forget me, if you can; an&rsquo; when
      this passes away out of her mind, she may yet be happy&mdash;a happy wife
      and a happy mother&mdash;an&rsquo; she can then think of her love for Connor
      O&rsquo;Donovan, only as a troubled dream that she had in her early life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;this is not right&mdash;you must be firmer;&rdquo;
       but as he uttered the words of reproof, the tears almost came to his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for my part,&rdquo; continued Connor, &ldquo;what is the world to me now, that
      I&rsquo;ve lost her? It is&mdash;it is a hard and a dark fate, but why it should
      fall upon us I do not know. It&rsquo;s as much as I can do to bear it as I
      ought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; replied John, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t dwell too much on it. I have something
      else to speak to you about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dwell on it!&rdquo; returned the other; &ldquo;as God is above me, she&rsquo;s not one
      minute out of my thoughts; an&rsquo; I tell you, I&rsquo;d rather be dead this minute,
      than forget her. Her memory now is the only happiness that is left to me&mdash;my
      only wealth in this world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;it is not. Connor, I have now a few words to say to you,
      and I know they will prove whether you are as generous as you are said to
      be; and whether your love for iny sister is truly tender and
      disinterested. You have it now in your power to ease her heart very much
      of a heavy load of concern which she feels on your account. Your father,
      you know, is now a ruined man, or I should say a poor man. You are going
      out under circumstances the most painful. In the country to which you are
      unhappily destined, you will have no friends&mdash;and no one living feels
      this more acutely than Una; for, observe me, I am now speaking on her
      behalf, and acting in her name. I am her agent. Now Una is richer than you
      might imagine, being the possessor of a legacy left her by our grandfather
      by my father&rsquo;s side. Of this legacy, she herself stands in no need&mdash;but
      you may and will, when you reach a distant country. Now, Connor, you see
      how that admirable creature loves you&mdash;you see how that love would
      follow you to the uttermost ends of the earth. Will you, or rather are you
      capable of being as generous as she is?&mdash;and can you show her that
      you are as much above the absurd prejudice of the world, and its cold
      forms, as he ought to be who is loved by a creature so truly generous and
      delicate as Una? You know how very poorly she is at present in health; and
      I tell you candidly, that your declining to accept this as a gift and
      memorial by which to remember her, may be attended with very serious
      consequences to her health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connor kept his eyes fixed upon the speaker, with a look of deep and
      earnest attention; and as O&rsquo;Brien detailed with singular address and
      delicacy these striking proofs of Una&rsquo;s affection, her lover&rsquo;s countenance
      became an index of the truth with which his heart corresponded to the
      noble girl&rsquo;s tenderness and generosity. He seized O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you are worthy of bein&rsquo; Una&rsquo;s brother, and I could say
      nothing higher in your favor; but, in the mane time, you and she both know
      that I want nothing to enable me to remember her by. This is a proof, I
      grant you, that she loves me truly; but I knew that as well before, as I
      do now. In this business I cannot comply with her wish an&rsquo; yours, an&rsquo; you
      musn&rsquo;t press me. You, I say, musn&rsquo;t press me. Through my whole life I have
      never lost my own good opinion; but if I did what you want me now to do, I
      couldn&rsquo;t respect myself&mdash;I would feel lowered in my own mind. In
      short, I&rsquo;d feel unhappy, an&rsquo; that I was too mane to be worthy of your
      sister. Once for all, then, I cannot comply in this business with your
      wish an&rsquo; hers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the anxiety produced by your refusal may have very dangerous effects
      on her health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you must contrive somehow to consale my refusal from her till she
      gets recovered. I couldn&rsquo;t do what you want me; an&rsquo; if you press me
      further upon it, I&rsquo;ll think you don&rsquo;t respect me as much as I&rsquo;d wish her
      brother to do. Oh, God of Heaven!&rdquo; he exclaimed, clasping his hands, &ldquo;must
      I lave you, my darling Una, forever? I must, I must! an&rsquo; the drame of all
      we hoped is past&mdash;but never, never, will she lave my heart! Her eye
      dim, an&rsquo; her cheek pale! an&rsquo; all forme&mdash;for a man covered with shame
      and disgrace! Oh, John, John, what a heart!&mdash;to love me in spite of
      all this, an&rsquo; in spite of the world&rsquo;s opinion along with it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment one of the turnkeys entered, and told him that his mother
      and a young lady were coming up to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I am glad she is come; but I didn&rsquo;t expect her
      till the day after to&mdash;morrow. A young lady! Heavens above, what
      young lady would come with my mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He involuntarily exchanged looks with O&rsquo;Brien, and a thought flashed on
      the instant across the minds of both. They immediately understood each
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;it can be no other&mdash;it is she&mdash;it is
      Una. Good God, how is this? The interview and separation will be more than
      she can bear&mdash;she will sink under it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connor made no reply, but sat down and pressed his right hand upon his
      forehead, as if to collect energy sufficient to meet the double trial
      which was now before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only one course, John,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;now, and that is, to appear to
      be&mdash;what I am not&mdash;a firm&mdash;hearted man. I must try to put
      on a smiling face before them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it be Una,&rdquo; returned the other, &ldquo;I shall withdraw for a while. I know
      her extreme bashfulness in many cases; and I know, too, that anything like
      restraint upon her heart at present&mdash;in a word, I shall retire for a
      little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be as well,&rdquo; said Connor; &ldquo;but so far as I am concerned, it makes
      no difference&mdash;just as you think proper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother will be a sufficient witness,&rdquo; said the delicate&mdash;minded
      brother; &ldquo;but I will see you again after they have left you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must,&rdquo; replied O&rsquo;Donovan. &ldquo;Oh I see me&mdash;see me again. I have
      something to say to you of more value even than Una&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door then opened, and assisted, or rather supported, by the governor
      of the gaol, and one of the turnkeys, Honor O&rsquo;Donovan and Una O&rsquo;Brien
      entered the gloomy cell of the guiltless convict.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation in which O&rsquo;Donovan was now placed will be admitted, we
      think, by the reader, to have been one equally unprecedented and
      distressing. It has been often said, and on many occasions with perfect
      truth, that opposite states of feeling existing in the same breast
      generally neutralize each other. In Connor&rsquo;s heart, however, there was in
      this instance nothing of a conflicting nature. The noble boy&rsquo;s love for
      such a mother bore in its melancholy beauty a touching resemblance to the
      purity of his affection for Una O&rsquo;Brien&mdash;each exhibiting in its
      highest character those virtues which made the heart of the mother proud
      and! loving, and that of his beautiful girl generous and devoted. So far,
      therefore, from their appearance together tending to concentrate his moral
      fortitude, it actually divided his strength, and forced him to meet each
      with a I heart subdued and softened by his love for the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they entered, therefore, he approached! them, smiling as well as he
      could; and, first taking a hand of each, would have led them over to a
      deal form beside the fire, but it was soon evident, that, owing to their
      weakness and agitation united, they required greater support. He and
      O&rsquo;Brien accordingly helped them to a seat, on which they sat with every
      symptom of that exhaustion which results at once from illness and mental
      suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us not forget to inform our readers that the day of this mournful
      visit was that on which, according to his original sentence, he should
      have yielded up his life as a penalty to the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear mother,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you an&rsquo; Una know that this day ought not to be
      a day of sorrow among us. Only for the goodness of my friends, an&rsquo; of
      Government, it&rsquo;s not my voice you&rsquo;d be now listening to&mdash;but that is
      now changed&mdash;so no more about it. I&rsquo;m glad to see you both able to
      come out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His mother, on first sitting down, clasped her hands together, and in a
      silent ejaculation, with closed eyes, raised her heart to the Almighty, to
      supplicate aid and strength to enable her to part finally with that boy
      who was, and ever had been, dearer to her than her own heart. Una
      trembled, and on meeting her brother so unexpectedly, blushed faintly,
      and, indeed, appeared to breathe with difficulty. She held a bottle of
      smelling salts in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I will explain this visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Una,&rdquo; he replied, affectionately, &ldquo;you need not&mdash;it requires
      none&mdash;and I beg you will not think of it one moment more. I must now
      leave you together for about half an hour, as I have some business to do
      in town that will detain me about that time.&rdquo; He then left them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor,&rdquo; said his mother, &ldquo;sit down between this darlin&rsquo; girl an&rsquo; me,
      till I spake to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down and took a hand of each.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A darlin&rsquo; girl she is, mother. It&rsquo;s now I see how very ill you have been,
      my own Una.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I was ill&mdash;but when I heard that your life was
      spared, I got better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This she said with an artless but melancholy naivete, that was very trying
      to the fortitude of her lover. As she spoke she looked fondly but
      mournfully into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor,&rdquo; proceeded his mother, &ldquo;I hope you are fully sensible of the
      mercy God has shown you, under this great trial?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I am, indeed, my dear mother. It is to God I surely owe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, an&rsquo; I trust that, go where you will and live where you may, the
      day will never come when you&rsquo;ll forget the debt you owe the Almighty, for
      preventin&rsquo; you from bein&rsquo; cut down like a flower in the very bloom of your
      life. I hope, avillish machree, that that day will never come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid it ever should, mother dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thin you may learn from what has happened, avick agus asthofe, never, oh
      never, to despair of God&rsquo;s mercy&mdash;no matter into what thrial or
      difficulty you maybe brought. You see, whin you naither hoped for it here,
      nor expected it, how it came for all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It did, blessed be God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; now, ahagur, to a strange land, where you&rsquo;ll meet&mdash;ay,
      where my darlin&rsquo; boy will meet the worst of company; but remember, alanna
      avillish, that your mother, well as she loves you, an&rsquo; well, I own, as you
      deserve to be loved&mdash;that mother that hung over the cradle of her
      only one&mdash;that dressed him, an&rsquo; reared him, an&rsquo; felt many a proud
      heart out of him&mdash;that mother would sooner at any time see him in his
      grave, his sowl bein&rsquo; free from stain, than to know that his heart was
      corrupted by the world, an&rsquo; the people you&rsquo;ll meet in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something in the last sentence must have touched a chord in Una&rsquo;s heart,
      for the tears, without showing any other&rsquo; external signs of emotion,
      streamed down her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My advice, then, to you&mdash;an&rsquo; oh, avick machree, machree, it is my
      last, the last you will ever hear from my lips&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mother, mother!&rdquo; exclaimed Connor, but he could not proceed&mdash;voice
      waa denied him, Una here sobbed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bore your thrial nobly, my darlin&rsquo; son&mdash;you must thin bear this
      as well; an&rsquo; you, a colleen dhas, remember your promise to me afore I
      consulted to come with you this day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The weeping girl here dried her eyes, and, by a strong effort, hushed her
      grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My advice, thin, to you, is never to neglect your duty to God; for, if
      you do it wanst or twist, you&rsquo;ll begin by degrees to get careless&mdash;thin,
      bit by bit, asthore, your heart will harden, your conscience will leave
      you, an&rsquo; wickedness, an&rsquo; sin, an&rsquo; guilt will come upon you. It&rsquo;s no
      matter, asthore, how much wicked comrades may laugh an&rsquo; jeer at you, keep
      you thrue to the will of your good God, an&rsquo; to your religious duties, an&rsquo; 
      let them take their own coorse. Will you promise me to do this, <i>avuillish
      machree?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, I have always sthrove to do it, an&rsquo; with God&rsquo;s assistance, always
      will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo;, my son, too, will you bear up undher this like a man? Remember,
      Connor darlin&rsquo;, that although you&rsquo;re lavin&rsquo; us forever, yet your poor
      father an&rsquo; I have the blessed satisfaction of knowin&rsquo; that we&rsquo;re not
      childless&mdash;that you&rsquo;re alive, an&rsquo; that you may yet do well an&rsquo; be
      happy. I mintion these things, acushla machree, to show you that there&rsquo;s
      nothin&rsquo; over you so bad, but you may show yourself firm and manly undher
      it&mdash;act as you have done. It&rsquo;s you, asthore, ought to comfort your
      father an me; an&rsquo; I hope, whin you&rsquo;re parted from, him, that you &lsquo;ill&mdash;Oh
      God, support him! I wish, Connor, darlin&rsquo;, that that partin&rsquo; was over, but
      I depend upon you to make it as light upon him as you can do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused, apparently from exhaustion. Indeed, it was evident, either
      that she had little else to add, or that she felt too weak to speak much
      more, with such a load of sorrow and affliction on her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one thing, Connor jewel, that I needn&rsquo;t mintion. Of coorse
      you&rsquo;ll write to us as often as you convaniently can. Oh, do not forget
      that! for you know that that bit of paper from your own hand, is all
      belongin&rsquo; to you we will ever see more. Avick machree, machree, many a
      long look&mdash;out we will have for it. It may keep the ould man&rsquo;s heart
      from breakin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent, but, as she uttered the last words, there was a shaking of
      the voice, which gave clear proof of the difficulty with which she went
      through the solemn task of being calm, which, for the sake of her son, she
      had heroically imposed upon herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was now silent, but, as is usual with Irish women under the influence
      of sorrow, she rocked herself involuntary to and fro, whilst, with closed
      eyes, and hands clasped as before, she held communion with God, the only
      true source of comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor,&rdquo; she added, after a pause, during which he and Una, though silent
      from respect to her, were both deeply affected; &ldquo;sit fornint me, avick
      machree, that, for the short time you&rsquo;re to be with me, I may have you
      before my eyes. Husth now, a colleen machree, an&rsquo; remimber your promise.
      Where&rsquo;s the stringth you said you&rsquo;d show?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then gazed with a long look of love and sorrow upon the fine
      countenance of her manly son, and nature would be no longer restrained&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me lay my head upon your breast,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m attemptin&rsquo; too much&mdash;the
      mother&rsquo;s heart will give out the mother&rsquo;s voice&mdash;will speak the
      mother&rsquo;s sorrow! Oh, my son, my son, my darlin&rsquo;, manly son&mdash;are you
      lavin&rsquo; your lovin&rsquo; mother for evermore, for evermore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was overcome; placing her head upon his bosom, her grief fell into
      that beautiful but mournful wail with which, in Ireland, those of her sex
      weep over the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, the scene assumed a tenderness, from this incident, which was
      inexpressibly affecting, inasmuch as the cry of death was but little out
      of place when bewailing that beloved boy, whom, by the stern decree of
      law, she was never to see again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connor kissed her pale cheek and lips, and rained down a flood of bitter
      tears upon her face; and Una, borne away by the enthusiasm of her sorrow,
      threw her arms also around her, and wept aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, after having, in some degree, eased her heart, she sat up, and
      with that consideration and good sense for which she had ever been
      remarkable, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nature must have its way; an&rsquo; surely, within reason, it&rsquo;s not sinful,
      seein&rsquo; that God himself has given us the feelin&rsquo;s of sorrow, whin thim
      that we love is lavin&rsquo; us&mdash;lavin&rsquo; us never, never to see them agin.
      It&rsquo;s only nature, afther all; and now ma colleen dhas&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her allusion to the final separation of those who love&mdash;or, in her
      own words, &ldquo;to the feelin&rsquo;s of sorrow, whin thim that we love is lavin us&rdquo;&mdash;was
      too much for the heart and affections of the fair girl at her side, whose
      grief now passed all the bounds which her previous attempts at being firm
      had prescribed to it.

    </div>
    <p>
      O&rsquo;Donovan took the beloved one in his arms, and, in the long embrace which
      ensued, seldom were love and sorrow so singularly and mournfully blended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to prevent you from cryin&rsquo; a colleen machree; for I know it
      will lighten an&rsquo; aise your heart,&rdquo; said Honor; &ldquo;but remimber your wakeness
      an&rsquo; your poor health; an&rsquo;, Connor avourneen, don&rsquo;t you&mdash;if you love
      her&mdash;don&rsquo;t forget the state her health&rsquo;s in either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, mother, you know it&rsquo;s the last time I&rsquo;ll ever look upon my Una&rsquo;s
      face again,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Oh, well may I be loath an&rsquo; unwillin&rsquo; to part
      with her. You&rsquo;ll think of me, my darlin&rsquo; life, when I&rsquo;m gone&mdash;not as
      a guilty man, Una dear, but as one that if he ever committed a crime, it
      was lovin&rsquo; you an&rsquo; bringin&rsquo; you to this unhappy state.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God sees my heart this day,&rdquo; she replied&mdash;and she spoke with
      difficulty&mdash;&ldquo;that I could and would have travelled over the world;
      borne joy and sorrow, hardship and distress&mdash;good fortune and bad&mdash;all
      happily, if you had been by my side&mdash;if you had not been taken from
      me. Oh, Connor, Connor, you may well pity your Una&mdash;for yours I am
      and was&mdash;another&rsquo;s I never will be. You are entering into scenes that
      will relieve you by their novelty&mdash;that will force you to think of
      other things and of other persons than those you&rsquo;ve left behind you; but
      oh, what Can I look upon that will not fill my heart with despair and
      sorrow, by reminding me of you and your affection?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fareer gair,&rdquo; exclaimed the mother, speaking involuntarily aloud, and
      interrupting her own words with sobs of bitter anguish&mdash;&ldquo;Fareer gair,
      ma colleen dhas, but that&rsquo;s the heavy truth with us all. Oh, the ould man&mdash;the
      ould man&rsquo;s heart will break all out, when he looks upon the place, an&rsquo; 
      everything else that our boy left behind him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Una,&rdquo; said Connor, &ldquo;you know that we&rsquo;re partin&rsquo; now forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My breaking heart tells me that,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I would give the wealth
      of the world that it was not so&mdash;I would&mdash;I would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, my own life. You must not let love for me lie so heavy upon
      your heart. Go out and keep your mind employed upon other thoughts&mdash;by
      degrees you&rsquo;ll forget&mdash;no, I don&rsquo;t think you could altogether forget
      me&mdash;me&mdash;the first, Una, you ever loved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the last, Connor&mdash;the last I ever will love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. In the presence of my lovin&rsquo; mother I say that you must not think
      that way. Time will pass, my own Una, an&rsquo; you will yet be happy with some
      other. You&rsquo;re very young; an&rsquo;, as I said, time will wear me by degrees out
      of your mimory.&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Una broke hastily from his embrace, for she lay upon his breast all this
      time&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so, Connor O&rsquo;Donovan?&rdquo; she exclaimed; but on looking into
      his face, and reading the history of deep&mdash;seated sorrow which
      appeared there so legible, she again &ldquo;fled to him and wept.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I cannot quarrel with you now; but you do the
      heart of your own Una injustice, if you think it could ever feel happiness
      with another. Already I have my mother&rsquo;s consent to enter a convent&mdash;and
      to enter a convent is my fixed determination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mother,&rdquo; said Connor, &ldquo;How will I lave this blessed girl? how will I
      part with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Honor rose up, and, by two or three simple words, disclosed more forcibly,
      more touchingly, than any direct exhibition of grief could have done, the
      inexpressible power of the misery she felt at this eternal separation from
      her only boy. She seized Una&rsquo;s two hands, and, kissing her lips, said, in
      tones of the most heart&mdash;rending pathos&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Una, Una, pity me&mdash;I am his mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Una threw herself into her arms, and sobbed out&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thin you&rsquo;ll obey me as a daughter should,&rdquo; said Honor. &ldquo;This is too much
      for you, Oona; part we both must from him, an&rsquo; neither of us is able to
      bear much, more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She here gave Connor a private signal to be firm, pointing unobservedly to
      Una&rsquo;s pale cheek, which at that moment lay upon her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor,&rdquo; she proceeded, &ldquo;Oona has what you sent her. Nogher&mdash;an&rsquo; he
      is breakin&rsquo; his heart too&mdash;gave it to me; an&rsquo; my daughter, for I will
      always call her so, has it this minute next her lovin&rsquo; heart. Here is
      hers, an&rsquo; let it lie next yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connor seized the glossy ringlet from his mother&rsquo;s hand, and placed it at
      the moment next to the seat of his undying affection for the fair girl
      from whose ebon locks it had been taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother then kissed Una again, and, rising, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my daughther, remimber I am your mother, an&rsquo; obey me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Una, attempting to repress her grief&mdash;&ldquo;I will; but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, darlin&rsquo;, you will. Now, Connor, my son, my son&mdash;Connor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, mother, darlin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re goin&rsquo;, Connor,&mdash;we&rsquo;re lavin&rsquo; you&mdash;be firm&mdash;be a man.
      Aren&rsquo;t you my son, Connor? my only son&mdash;an&rsquo; the ould man&mdash;an&rsquo; 
      never, never more&mdash;kneel down&mdash;kneel down, till I bless you. Oh,
      many, many a blessin&rsquo; has risen from your mother&rsquo;s lips an&rsquo; your mother&rsquo;s
      heart, to Heaven for you, my son, my son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connor knelt, his heart bursting, but he knelt not alone. By his side was
      his own Una, with meek and bended head, awaiting for his mothers blessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She then poured forth that blessing; first: upon him who was nearest to
      her heart, and afterwards upon the worn but still beautiful; girl, whose
      love for that adored son had made her so inexpressibly dear to her.
      Whilst! she uttered this fervent but sorrowful benediction, a hand was
      placed upon the head of each, after which she stooped and kissed them
      both, but without shedding a single tear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;comes the mother&rsquo;s wakeness; but my son will help me by
      his manliness&mdash;so will my daughter. I am very weak. Oh, what heart
      can know the sufferin&rsquo;s of this hour, but mine? My son, my son&mdash;Connor
      O&rsquo;Donovan, my son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment John O&rsquo;Brien entered the room; but the solemnity and pathos
      of her manner and voice hushed him so completely into silent attention,
      that it is probable she did not perceive him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me put my arms about him and kiss his lips once more, an&rsquo; then I&rsquo;ll
      say farewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She again approached the boy, who S opened his arms to receive her, and,
      after having kissed him and looked into his face, said, &ldquo;I will now go&mdash;I
      will&rsquo; now go;&rdquo; but instead of withdrawing, as she had intended, it was
      observed that she pressed him more closely to her heart than before; plied
      her hands about his neck and bosom, as if she were not actually conscious
      of what she did; and at length sunk into a forgetfulness of all her misery
      upon the aching breast of her unhappy son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Una, rising into a spirit of; unexpected fortitude, &ldquo;now,
      Connor, I will be her daughter, and you must be her son. The moment she
      recovers we must separate, and in such a manner as to show that our
      affection for each other shall not be injurious to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nature only,&rdquo; said her brother; &ldquo;or, in other words, the love that
      is natural to such a mother for such a son, that has overcome her. Connor,
      this must be ended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am willing it should,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;You must assist them home,
      and let me see you again tomorrow. I have something of the deepest
      importance to say to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Una&rsquo;s bottle of smelling salts soon relieved the woe-worn mother; and, ere
      the lapse of many minutes, she was able to summon her own natural firmness
      of character. The lovers, too, strove to be firm; and, after one long and
      last embrace, they separated from Connor with more composure than, from
      the preceding scene, might have been expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, according to promise, John O&rsquo;Brien paid him an early visit,
      in order to hear what Connor had assured him was of more importance even
      than Una&rsquo;s life itself. Their conference was long and serious, for each
      felt equally interested in its subject-matter. When it was concluded, and
      they had separated, O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s friends observed that he appeared like a man
      whose mind was occupied by something that occasioned him to feel deep
      anxiety. What the cause of this secret care was, he did not disclose to
      anyone except his father, to whom, in a few days afterwards, he mentioned
      it. His college vacation had now nearly expired; but it was mutually
      agreed upon, in the course of the communication he then made, that for the
      present he should remain with them at home, and postpone his return to
      Maynooth, if not abandon the notion of the priesthood altogether. When the
      Bodagh left his son, after this dialogue, his open, good-humored
      countenance seemed clouded, his brow thoughtful, and his whole manner that
      of a man who has heard something more than usually unpleasant; but,
      whatever this intelligence was, he, too, appeared equally studious to
      conceal it. The day now arrived on which Connor O&rsquo;Donovan was to see his
      other parent for the last time, and this interview he dreaded, on the old
      man&rsquo;s account, more than he had done even the separation from his mother.
      Our readers may judge, therefore, of his surprise on finding that his
      father exhibited a want of sorrow or of common feeling that absolutely
      amounted almost to indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connor felt it difficult to account for a change so singular and
      extraordinary in one with whose affection for himself he was so well
      acquainted. A little time, however, and an odd hint or two thrown out in
      the early part of their conversation, soon enabled him to perceive, either
      that the old man labored under some strange hallucination, or had
      discovered a secret source of comfort known only to himself. At length, it
      appeared to the son that he had discovered the cause of this unaccountable
      change in the conduct of his father; and, we need scarcely assure our
      readers, that his heart sank into new and deeper distress at the words
      from which he drew the inference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor,&rdquo; said the miser, &ldquo;I had great luck yestherday. You remember
      Antony Cusack, that ran away from me wid seventy-three pounds fifteen
      shillin&rsquo;s an&rsquo; nine pence, now betther than nine years ago. Many a curse he
      had from me for his roguery; but somehow, it seems he only thruv under
      them. His son Andy called on me yestherday mornin&rsquo; an&rsquo; paid me to the last
      farden, inthrest an&rsquo; all. Wasn&rsquo;t I in luck?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very fortunate, father, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m glad of it&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was, indeed, the hoighth o&rsquo; luck. Now, Connor, you think one thing,
      an&rsquo; that is, that; we&rsquo;re partin&rsquo; forever, an&rsquo; that we&rsquo;ll never see one
      another till we meet in the next world. Isn&rsquo;t that what you think?&mdash;eh,
      Connor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to tell what may happen, father. We may see one another even in
      this; stranger things have been brought about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, Connor, we&rsquo;ll meet agin; I have made out a plan in my own
      head for that; but the luckiest of all was the money yestherday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the plan, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ax me, avick, bekase it&rsquo;s betther for you not to know it. I may be
      disappointed, but it&rsquo;s not likely aither; still it &lsquo;ud be risin&rsquo; 
      expectations in you, an&rsquo; if it didn&rsquo;t come to pass, you&rsquo;d only be more
      unhappy; an&rsquo; you know, Connor darlin&rsquo;, I wouldn&rsquo;t wish to be the manes of
      making your poor heart sore for one minute. God knows the same young heart
      has suffered enough, an&rsquo; more than it ought to suffer. Connor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep up your spirits, darlin&rsquo;, don&rsquo;t be at all cast down, I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man caught his son&rsquo;s hands ere he spoke, and uttered these words
      with a voice of such tenderness and affection, that Connor, on seeing him
      assume the office of comforter, contrary to all he had expected, felt
      himself more deeply touched than if his father had fallen, as was his
      wont, into all the impotent violence of grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was only comin&rsquo; here to-day, Connor, that I thought of this plan; but
      I wish to goodness your poor mother knew it, for thin, maybe she&rsquo;d let me
      mintion it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it would make me any way unhappy,&rdquo; replied Connor, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not
      hear it; only, whatever it is, father, if it&rsquo;s against my dear mother&rsquo;s
      wishes, don&rsquo;t put it in practice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t, Connor, widout her consint, barrin&rsquo; we&rsquo;d&mdash;but there&rsquo;s no
      us in that; only keep up your spirits, Connor dear. Still I&rsquo;m glad it came
      into my head, this plan; for if I thought that I&rsquo;d never see you agin, I
      wouldn&rsquo;t know how to part wid you; my heart &lsquo;ud fairly break, or my head
      &lsquo;ud get light. Now, won&rsquo;t you promise me not to fret, acushla machree&mdash;an&rsquo; 
      to keep your heart up, an&rsquo; your spirits?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fret as little as I can, father. You know there&rsquo;s not much pleasure
      in frettin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; that no one would fret if they could avoid it; but will
      you promise me, my dear father, to be guided an&rsquo; advised, in whatever you
      do, or intend to do, by my mother&mdash;my blessed mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will&mdash;I will, Connor; an&rsquo; if I had always done so, maybe it isn&rsquo;t
      here now you&rsquo;d be standing, an&rsquo; my heart breakin&rsquo; to look at you; but,
      indeed, it was God, I hope, put this plan into my head; an&rsquo; the money
      yestherday&mdash;that, too, was so lucky&mdash;far more so, Connor dear,
      than you think. Only for that&mdash;but sure no matther, Connor, we&rsquo;re not
      partin&rsquo; for evermore now; so acushla machree, let your mind be aisy. Cheer
      up, cheer up my darlin&rsquo; son.&rdquo;
     </p>

      Much more conversation of this kind took place between them during the old
      man&rsquo;s stay, which he prolonged almost to the last hour. Connor wondered,
      as was but natural, what the plan so recently fallen upon by his father
      could be. Indeed, sometimes, he feared that the idea of their separation
      had shaken his intellect, and that his allusions to this mysterious
      discovery, mixed up, as they were, with the uncommon delight he expressed
      at having recovered Cusack&rsquo;s money, boded nothing less than the ultimate
      derangement of his faculties. One thing, however, seemed obvious&mdash;that,
      whatever it might be, whether reasonable or otherwise, his father&rsquo;s mind
      was exclusively occupied by it; and that, during the whole scene of their
      parting, it sustained him in a manner for which he felt it utterly
      impossible to account. It is true he did not leave him without shedding
      tears, and bitter tears; but they were unaccompanied by the wild vehemence
      of grief which had, on former occasions, raged through and almost
      desolated his heart. The reader may entertain some notion of what he would
      have felt on this occasion, were it not for the &ldquo;plan&rdquo; as he called it,
      which supported him so much, when we tell him that he blessed his son
      three or four times dining their interview, without being conscious; that
      he had blessed him more than once. His last words to him were to keep up
      his spirits, for that there was little doubt that they would meet again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, at daybreak, &ldquo;their noble boy,&rdquo; as they fondly and
      proudly called him, was conveyed, to the transport, in company with many
      others; and at the hour of five o&rsquo;clock p. m., that melancholy vessel
      weighed anchor, and spread her broad sails to the bosom of the ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the necessary affairs of life are, after all, the great assuager
      of sorrow, yet there are also cases where the heart persists in rejecting
      the consolation brought by time, and in clinging to the memory of that
      which it loved. Neither Honor O&rsquo;Donovan nor Una O&rsquo;Brien could forget our
      unhappy hero, nor school their affections into the apathy of ordinary
      feelings. Of Fardorougha we might say the same; for, although he probably
      felt the want of his son&rsquo;s presence more keenly even than his wife, yet
      his grief, notwithstanding its severity, was mingled with the interruption
      of a habit&mdash;such as is frequently the prevailing cause of sorrow in
      selfish and contracted minds. That there was much selfishness in his
      grief, our readers, we dare say, will admit. At all events, a scene which
      took place between him and his wife, on the night of the day which saw
      Connor depart from his native land forever, will satisfy them of the
      different spirit which marked their feelings on that unfortunate occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honor had, as might be expected, recovered her serious composure, and
      spent a great portion of that day in offering up her prayers for the
      welfare of their son. Indeed, much of her secret grief was checked by the
      alarm which she felt for her husband, whose conduct on that morning before
      he left home was marked by the wild excitement, which of late had been so
      peculiar to him. Her surprise was consequently great when she observed, on
      his return, that he manifested a degree of calmness, if not serenity,
      utterly at variance with the outrage of his grief, or, we should rather
      say, the delirium of his despair, in the early part of the day. She
      resolved, however, with her usual discretion, not to catechize him on the
      subject, lest his violence might revive, but to let his conduct explain
      itself, which she knew in a little time it would do. Nor was she mistaken.
      Scarcely had an hour elapsed, when, with something like exultation, he
      disclosed his plan, and asked her advice and opinion. She heard it
      attentively, and for the first time since the commencement of their
      affliction, did the mother&rsquo;s brow seem unburdened of the sorrow which sat
      upon it, and her eye to gleam with something like the light of expected
      happiness. It was, however, on their retiring to rest that night that the
      affecting contest took place, which exhibited so strongly the contrast
      between their characters. We mentioned, in a preceding part of this
      narrative, that ever since her son&rsquo;s incarceration Honor had slept in his
      bed, and with her head on the very pillow which he had so often pressed.
      As she was about to retire, Fardorougha, for a moment, appeared to forget
      his &ldquo;plan,&rdquo; and everything but the departure of his son. He followed Honor
      to his bedroom, which he traversed, distractedly clasping his hands,
      kissing his boy&rsquo;s clothes, and uttering sentiments of extreme misery and
      despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s his bed,&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s our boy&rsquo;s bed&mdash;but where is
      he himself? gone, gone forever! There&rsquo;s his clothes, our darlin&rsquo; son&rsquo;s
      clothes; look at them. Oh God! oh God! my heart will break outright. Oh
      Connor, our boy, our boy, are you gone from us forever! We must sit down
      to our breakfast in the mornin&rsquo;, to our dinner, an&rsquo; to our supper at
      night, but our noble boy&rsquo;s face we&rsquo;ll never see&mdash;his voice we&rsquo;ll
      never hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Fardorougha, it&rsquo;s thrue, it&rsquo;s thrue!&rdquo; replied the wife; &ldquo;but remember
      he&rsquo;s not in the grave, not in the clay of the churchyard; we haven&rsquo;t seen
      him carried there, and laid down undher the heart&mdash;breakin&rsquo; sound of
      the dead&mdash;bell; we haven&rsquo;t hard the cowld noise of the clay fallin&rsquo; 
      in upon his coffin. Oh no, no&mdash;thanks, everlastin&rsquo; thanks to God,
      that has spared our boy&rsquo;s life! How often have you an&rsquo; I hard people say
      over the corpses of their children, &lsquo;Oh, if he was only alive I didn&rsquo;t
      care in what part of the world it was, or if I was never to see his face
      again, only that he was livin&rsquo;!&rsquo; An&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t they, Fardorougha dear, give
      the world&rsquo;s wealth to&mdash;have their wishes? Oh they would, they would&mdash;an&rsquo; 
      thanks forever be to the Almighty! our boy is livin&rsquo; and may yit be happy.
      Fardorougha, let us not fly into the face of God, who has in His mercy
      spared our son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sleep in his bed,&rdquo; replied the husband; &ldquo;on the very spot he lay on
      I&rsquo;ll he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was, indeed, trenching, and selfishly trenching upon the last
      mournful privilege of the mother&rsquo;s heart. Her sleeping here was one of
      those secret but melancholy enjoyments, which the love of a mother or of a
      wife will often steal, like a miser&rsquo;s theft, from the very hoard of their
      own sorrows. In fact, she was not prepared for this, and when he spoke she
      looked at him for some time in silent amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, Fardorougha dear,the mother, the mother, that her breast was so
      often his pillow, has the best right, now that he&rsquo;s gone, to lay her head
      where his lay. Oh, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, lave that poor pleasure to me,
      Fardorougha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Honor, you can bear up undher grief better than I can. I must sleep
      where my boy slept.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fardorougha, I could go upon my knees! to you, an&rsquo; I will, avourneen, if
      you&rsquo;ll grant me this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he replied, distractedly; &ldquo;I could sleep nowhere else.
      I love everything belongin&rsquo; to him. I can&rsquo;t, Honor, I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fardorougha, my heart&mdash;his mother&rsquo;s heart is fixed upon it, an&rsquo; was.
      Oh lave this to me, acushla, lave this to me&mdash;it&rsquo;s all I axe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t, I couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;my heart is breakin&rsquo;&mdash;it&rsquo;ll be sweet to
      me&mdash;I&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;ll be nearer him,&rdquo; and as he uttered these words the
      tears flowed copiously down his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      His affectionate wife was touched with compassion, and immediately
      resolved to let him have his way, whatever it might cost herself. &ldquo;God
      pity you,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give it up, I&rsquo;ll give it up, Fardorougha. Do
      sleep where he slep&rsquo;; I can&rsquo;t blame you, nor I don&rsquo;t; for sure it&rsquo;s only a
      proof of how much you love him.&rdquo; She then bade him good&mdash;night, and,
      with spirits dreadfully weighed down by this singular incident, withdrew
      to her lonely pillow; for Connor&rsquo;s bed had been a single one, in which, of
      course, two persons could not sleep together. Thus did these bereaved
      parents retire to seek that rest which nothing but exhausted nature seemed
      disposed to give them, until at length they fell asleep under the double
      shadow of night and a calamity which filled their hearts with so much
      distress and misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time, whatever these two families might have felt for the
      sufferings of their respective children in consequence of Bartle
      Flanagan&rsquo;s villainy, that plausible traitor had watched the departure of
      his victim with a palpitating anxiety almost equal to what some unhappy
      culprit, in the dock of a prison, would experience when the foreman of his
      jury handed down the sentence which is either to hang or acquit him. Up to
      the very moment on which the vessel sailed, his cruel but cowardly heart
      was literally sick with the apprehension that Connor&rsquo;s mitigated sentence
      might be still further commuted to a term of imprisonment. Great,
      therefore, was his joy, and boundless his exultation on satisfying himself
      that he was now perfectly safe in the crime he had committed, and that his
      path was never to be crossed by him, whom, of all men living, he had most
      feared and hated. The reader is not to suppose, however, that by the ruin
      of Connor, and the revenge he consequently had gained upon Fardorougha,
      the scope of his dark designs was by any means accomplished. Far from it;
      the fact is, his measures were only in a progressive state. In Nogher
      M&rsquo;Cormick&rsquo;s last interview with Connor, our readers will please to
      remember that a hint had been thrown out by that attached old follower, of
      Flanagan&rsquo;s entertaining certain guilty purposes involving nothing less
      than the abduction of Una. Now, in justice even to Flanagan, we are bound
      to say that no one living had ever received from himself any intimation of
      such an intention. The whole story was fabricated by Nogher for the
      purpose of getting Connor&rsquo;s consent to the vengeance which it had been
      determined to execute upon his enemy. By a curious coincidence,
      however,the story, though decidedly false so far as Nogher knew to the
      contrary, happened to be literally and absolutely true. Flanagan, indeed,
      was too skilful and secret, either to precipitate his own designs until
      the feeling of the parties should abate and settle down, or to place
      himself at the mercy of another person&rsquo;s honesty. He knew his own heart
      too well to risk his life by such dangerous and unseasonable confidence.
      Some months consequently passed away since. Connor&rsquo;s departure, when an
      event took place, which gave him still greater security. This was nothing
      less than the fulfilment by Fardorougha of that plan to which he looked
      forward with such prospective satisfaction, Connor had not been a month
      gone when his father commenced to dispose of his property, which he soon
      did, having sold out his farm to good advantage. He then paid his rent,
      the only debt he owed; and, having taken a passage to New South Wales for
      himself and Honor, they departed with melancholy satisfaction to seek that
      son without whose society they found their desolate hearth gloomier than
      the cell of a prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was followed, too, by another circumstance&mdash;but one apparently
      of little importance&mdash;which was, the removal of Biddy Nulty to the
      Bodagh&rsquo;s family, through the interference of Una, by whom she was treated
      with singular affection, and admitted to her confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the position of the parties after, the lapse of five months
      subsequent to the transportation of Connor. Flanagan had conducted himself
      with great circumspection, and, so far as public observation could go,
      with much propriety. There was no change whatsoever perceptible, either in
      his dress or manner except that alluded to by Nogher of his altogether
      declining to taste any intoxicating liquor. In truth, so well did he act
      his part, that the obloquy raised against him at the period of Connor&rsquo;s
      trial was nearly, if not altogether, removed, and many persons once more
      adopted an impression of his victim&rsquo;s guilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      With respect to the Bodagh and his son, the anxiety which we have
      described them as feeling in consequence of the latter&rsquo;s interview with
      O&rsquo;Donovan, was now completely removed. Una&rsquo;s mother had nearly forgotten
      both the crime and its consequences; but upon the spirit of her daughter
      there appeared to rest a silent and settled sorrow not likely to be
      diminished or removed. Her cheerfulness had abandoned her, and many an
      hour did she contrive to spend with Biddy Nulty, eager in the mournful
      satisfaction of talking over all that affection prompted of her banished
      lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must now beg our readers to accompany us to a scene of a different
      description from any we have yet drawn. The night of a November day had
      set in, or rather had advanced so far as nine o&rsquo;clock, and towards the
      angle of a small three-cornered field, called by a peculiar coincidence of
      name, Oona&rsquo;s Handkerchief, in consequence of an old legend connected with
      it, might be seen moving a number of straggling figures, sometimes in
      groups of fours and fives; sometimes in twos or threes as the case might
      be, and not unfrequently did a single straggler advance, and, after a few
      private words, either join the others or proceed alone to a house situated
      in the angular corner of the field to which we allude. As the district was
      a remote one, and the night rather dark, several shots might be heard as
      they proceeded, and several flashes in the pan seen from the rusty arms of
      those who were probably anxious to pull a trigger for the first time. The
      country, at the period we write of, be it observed, was in a comparative
      state of tranquility, and no such thing as a police corps had been heard
      of or known in the neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the lower end of a long, level kind of moor called the Black Park, two
      figures approached a* kind of gate or pass that opened into it. One of
      them stood until the other advanced, and, in a significant tone, asked who
      comes there?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend to the guard,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morrow,&rdquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morrow mornin&rsquo; to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What age are you in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the end of the Fifth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; come on, boy; the true blood&rsquo;s in you, whoever you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; is it possible you don&rsquo;t know me, Dandy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix, it is; I forgot my spectacles tonight. Who the dickins are you at
      all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you purtind to forget Ned M&rsquo;Cormick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it Nogher&rsquo;s son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The divil a other; an&rsquo;, Dandy Duffy, how are you, man alive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you see, Ned, I&rsquo;ve been so long out of the counthry, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m now so
      short a time back, that, upon my sowl, I forget a great many of my ould
      acquaintances, especially them that wor only slips when I wint acrass.
      Faith, I&rsquo;m purty well considherin, Ned, I thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad luck to them that sint you acrass, Dandy; not but that you got off
      purty well on the whole, by all accounts. They say only that Rousin
      Redhead swore like a man you&rsquo;d &lsquo;a&rsquo; got a touch of the Shaggy Shoe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the divil wid it all now, Ned; let us have no more about it; I don&rsquo;t
      for my own part like to think of it. Have you any notion of what we&rsquo;re
      called upon for to&mdash;night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divil the laste; but I believe, Dandy, that Bartle&rsquo;s not the white-headed
      boy wid you no more nor wid some more of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him! a double-distilled villain. Faith, there wor never good that had the
      white liver; an&rsquo; he has it to the backbone. My brother Lachlin, that&rsquo;s now
      dead, God rest him, often tould me about the way he tricked him and Barney
      Bradly when they wor greenhorns about nineteen or twenty. He got them to
      join him in stealin&rsquo; a sheep for their Christmas dinner, he said; so they
      all three stole it; an&rsquo; the blaggard skinned and cut it up, sendin&rsquo; my
      poor boacun of a brother home to hide the skin in the straw in our barn,
      and poor Barney, wid only the head an&rsquo; trotters, to hide them in his
      father&rsquo;s tow-house. Very good; in a day or two the neighbors wor all
      called upon to clear themselves upon the holy Evangelisp; and the two
      first that he egg&rsquo;d an&rsquo; to do it was my brother an&rsquo; Barney. Of coorse he
      switched the primmer himself that he was innocent; but whin it was all
      over some one sint Jarmy Campel, that lost the sheep, to the very spot
      where they hid the fleece an&rsquo; trot&mdash;ters. Jarmy didn&rsquo;t wish to say
      much about it; so he tould them if they&rsquo;d fairly acknowledge it an&rsquo; pay
      him betune them for the sheep, he&rsquo;d dhrop it. My father an&rsquo; Andy Bradly
      did so, an&rsquo; there it ended; but purshue the morsel of mutton ever they
      tasted in the mane time. As for Bartle, he managed the thing so well that
      at the time they never suspected him, although divil a other could betray
      them, for he was the only one knew it; an&rsquo; he had the aiten o&rsquo; the mutton,
      too, the blaggard! Faith, Ned, I know him well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has conthrived to get a strong back o&rsquo; the boys, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has, an&rsquo; &lsquo;tis that, and bekase he&rsquo;s a good hand to be undher for my
      revinge on Blennerhasset, that made me join him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunna what could make him refuse to let Alick Nulty join him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it my cousin from Annaloghan? an&rsquo; did he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divil a lie in it; it&rsquo;s as thrue as you&rsquo;re standin&rsquo; there; but do you
      know what is suspected?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that he has an eye on Bodagh Buie&rsquo;s daughter. Alick towld me that,
      for a long time afther Connor O&rsquo;Donovan was thransported, the father an&rsquo; 
      son wor afeard of him. He hard it from his sister Biddy, an&rsquo; it appears
      that the Bodagh&rsquo;s daughter tould her family that he used to stare her out
      of countenance at mass, an&rsquo; several times struv to put the furraun on her
      in hopes to get acquainted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would do it; an&rsquo; my hand to you, if he undhertakes it he&rsquo;ll not fail;
      an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll tell you another thing, if he suspected that I knew anything
      about the thraitherous thrick he put on my poor brother, the divil a toe
      he&rsquo;d let me join him; but you see I&mdash;was only a mere gorsoon, a child
      I may say at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events let us keep an eye on him; an&rsquo; in regard to Connor
      O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s business, let him not be too sure that it&rsquo;s over wid him yet.
      At any rate, by dad, my father has slipped out a name upon him an&rsquo; us that
      will do him no good. The other boys now call us the Stags of Lisdhu, that
      bein&rsquo; the place where his father lived, an&rsquo; the nickname you see rises out
      of his thrachery to poor Connor O&rsquo;Donovan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he ever give any hint himself about carryin&rsquo; away the Bodagh&rsquo;s pretty
      daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it him&rsquo;? Oh, oh! catch him at it; he&rsquo;s a damn sight too close to do
      any sich thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After some further conversation upon that and other topics, they arrived
      at the place of appointment, which was a hedge school-house; one of those
      where the master, generally an unmarried man, merely wields his sceptre
      during school-hours, leaving it open and uninhabited for the rest of the
      twenty-four.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of those who were here assembled was indeed singularly
      striking. A large fire of the unconsumed peat brought by the scholars on
      that morning, was kindled in the middle of the floor&mdash;it&rsquo;s usual
      site. Around, upon stones, hobs, bosses, and seats of various
      descriptions, sat the &ldquo;boys&rdquo;&mdash;some smoking and others drinking; for
      upon nights of this kind, a shebeen-housekeeper, uniformly a member of
      such societies, generally attends for the sale of his liquor, if he cannot
      succeed in prevailing on them to hold their meetings in his own house&mdash;a
      circumstance which for many reasons may not be in every case advisable. As
      they had not all yet assembled, nor the business of the night commenced,
      they were, of course, divided into several groups and engaged in various
      amusements. In the lower end of the house was a knot, busy at the game of
      &ldquo;spoiled five,&rdquo; their ludicrous table being the crown of a hat, placed
      upon the floor in the centre. These all sat upon the ground, their legs
      stretched out, their torch-bearer holding a lit bunch of fir splinters,
      stuck for convenience sake into the muzzle of a horse-pistol. In the upper
      end, again, sat another clique, listening to a man who was reading a
      treasonable ballad. Such of them as could themselves read stretched over
      their necks in eagerness to peruse it along with him, and such as could
      not&mdash;indeed, the greater number&mdash;gave force to its principles by
      very significant gestures; some being those of melody, and others those of
      murder; that is to say, part of them were attempting to hum a tune in a
      low voice, suitable to the words, whilst others more ferocious brandished
      their weapons, as if those against whom the spirit of the ballad was
      directed had been then within the reach of their savage passions. Beside
      the fire, and near the middle of the house, sat a man, who, by his black
      stock and military appearance, together with a scar over his brow that
      gave him a most repulsive look, was evidently a pensioner or old soldier.
      This person was engaged in examining some rusty fire-arms that had been
      submitted to his inspection. His self-importance was amusing, as was also
      the deferential aspect of those who, with arms in their hands, hammering
      flints or turning screws, awaited patiently their turn for his opinion of
      their efficiency. But perhaps the most striking group of all was that in
      which a thick-necked, bull-headed young fellow, with blood-colored hair, a
      son of Rousin Redhead&rsquo;s&mdash;who, by the way, was himself present&mdash;and
      another beetle-browed slip were engaged in drawing for a wager, upon one
      of the school-boy&rsquo;s slates, the figure of a coffin and cross-bones. A
      hardened-looking old sinner, with murder legible in his face, held the few
      half-pence which they wagered in his open hand, whilst in the other he
      clutched a pole, surmounted by a bent bayonet that had evidently seen
      service. The last group worthy of remark was composed of a few persons who
      were writing threatening notices upon a leaf torn out of a school-boy&rsquo;s
      copy, which was laid upon what they formerly termed a copy-board, of plain
      deal, kept upon the knees, as a substitute for desks, while the boys were
      writing. This mode of amusement was called waiting for the Article-bearer,
      or the Captain, for such was Bartle Flanagan, who now entered the house,
      and saluted all present with great cordiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begad, boys,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;our four guards widout is worth any money. I had
      to pass the sign-word afore &lsquo;I could pass myself, and that&rsquo;s the way it
      ought to be. But, boys, before we go further, an&rsquo; for fraid of thraitors,
      I must call the rowl. You&rsquo;ll stand in a row roun&rsquo; the walls, an&rsquo; thin we
      can make sure that there&rsquo;s no spies among us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then called out a roll of those who were members of his lodge and,
      having ascertained that all was right, he proceeded immediately to
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rousin Redhead, what&rsquo;s the raisin you didn&rsquo;t take the arms from Captain
      St. Ledger&rsquo;s stewart? Sixteen men armed was enough to do it, an&rsquo; yees
      failed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, an&rsquo; if you had been wid us, and sixteen more to the back o&rsquo; that,
      you&rsquo;d failed too. Begarra, captain dear, it seems that good people is
      scarce. Look at Mickey Mulvather there, you see his head tied up; but aldo
      he can play cards well enough, be me sowl, he&rsquo;s short of wan ear any how,
      an&rsquo; if you could meet wan o&rsquo; the same Stewart&rsquo;s bullets, goin&rsquo; abroad at
      night like ourselves for its divarsion, it might tell how he lost it.
      Bartle, I tell you a number of us isn&rsquo;t satisfied wid you. You sends us
      out to meet danger, an&rsquo; you won&rsquo;t come yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know, Rouser, that I always do go whenever I can? But I&rsquo;m caged
      now; faix I don&rsquo;t sleep in a barn, and can&rsquo;t budge as I used to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; who&rsquo;s tyin&rsquo; you to your place, thin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rouser,&rdquo; replied Bartle, &ldquo;I wish I had a thousand like you, not but I
      have fine fellows. Boys, the thruth is this, you must all meet here
      to-morrow night, for the short an&rsquo; long of it is, that I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to run
      away wid a wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Redhead, &ldquo;sure you can do that widout our assistance, if
      she&rsquo;s willin&rsquo; to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willin&rsquo;! why,&rdquo; replied Bartle, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s by her own appointment we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; if it is, then,&rdquo; said the Rouser, who, in truth, was the leader of
      the suspicious and disaffected party in Flanagan&rsquo;s lodge, &ldquo;what the blazes
      use have you for us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rouser Redhead,&rdquo; said Bartle, casting a suspicious and malignant glance
      at him, &ldquo;might I take the liberty of axin&rsquo; what you mane by spakin&rsquo; of me
      in that disparagin&rsquo; manner? Do you renumber your oath? or do you forget
      that you&rsquo;re bound by it to meet at twelve hours&rsquo; notice, or less, whinever
      you&rsquo;re called upon? Dar Chriestha! man, if I hear another word of the kind
      out of your lips, down you go on the black list. Boys,&rdquo; he proceeded, with
      a wheedling look of good-humor to the rest, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have neither Spies nor
      Stags here, come or go what may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stags!&rdquo; replied Rouser Redhead, whose face had already become scarlet
      with indignation. &ldquo;Stags, you say, Bartle Flanagan! Arrah, boys, I wondher
      where is poor Connor O&rsquo;Donovan by this time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose bushin&rsquo; it afore now,&rdquo; said our friend of the preceding part of
      the night. &ldquo;I bushed it myself for a year and a half, but be Japurs I got
      sick of it. But any how, Bartle, you oughn&rsquo;t to spake of Stags, for
      although Connor refused to join us, damn your blood, you had no right to
      go to inform upon him. Sure, only for the intherest that was made for him,
      you&rsquo;d have his blood on your sowl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; if he had itself,&rdquo; observed one of Flanagan&rsquo;s friends, &ldquo;&lsquo;twould
      signify very little. The Bodagh desarved what he got, and more if he had
      got it. What right has he, one of our own purswadjion as he is to hould
      out against us the way he does? Sure he&rsquo;s as rich as a Sassenach, an&rsquo; may
      hell resave the farden he&rsquo;ll subscribe towards our gettin&rsquo; arms or
      ammunition, or towards defindin&rsquo; us when we&rsquo;re brought to thrial. So
      hell&rsquo;s delight wid the dirty Bodagh, says myself for wan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; is that by way of defince of Captain Bartle Flanagan?&rdquo; inquired
      Rouser Redhead, indignantly. &ldquo;An&rsquo; so our worthy captain sint the man
      across that punished our inimy, even accordian to your own provin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; 
      that by staggin&rsquo; aginst him. Of coorse, had the miser&rsquo;s son been one of
      huz, Bartle&rsquo;s brains would be scattered to the four quarthers of heaven
      long agone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; how did I know but he&rsquo;d stag aginst me?&rdquo; said Bartle, very calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn well you knew he would not,&rdquo; observed Ned M&rsquo;Cormick, now encouraged
      by the bold and decided manner of Rouser Redhead. &ldquo;Before ever you went
      into Fardorougha&rsquo;s sarvice you sed to more than one that you&rsquo;d make him
      sup sorrow for his harshness to your father and family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t he desarve it, Ned? Didn&rsquo;t he ruin us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might desarve it, an&rsquo; I suppose he did; but what right had you to
      punish the innocent for the guilty? You knew very well that both his son
      and his wife always set their faces against his doin&rsquo;s.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said Flanagan, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand this, and I tell you more I
      won&rsquo;t bear it. This night let any of you that doesn&rsquo;t like to be undher me
      say so. Rouser Redhead, you&rsquo;ll never meet in a Ribbon Lodge agin. You&rsquo;re
      scratched out of wan book, but by way of comfort you&rsquo;re down in another&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What other, Bartle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The black list. An&rsquo; now I have nothin&rsquo; more to say except that if there&rsquo;s
      anything on your mind that wants absolution, look to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We must now pause for a moment to observe upon that which we suppose the
      sagacity of the reader has already discovered&mdash;that is, the
      connection between what has occurred in Flanagan&rsquo;s lodge, and the last
      dialogue which took place between Nogher and Connor O&rsquo;Donovan. It is
      evident that Nogher had spirits at work for the purpose both of watching
      and contravening all Flanagan&rsquo;s plans, and, if possible, of drawing him
      into some position which might justify the &ldquo;few friends,&rdquo; as he termed
      them, first in disgracing him, and afterwards of settling their account
      ultimately with a man whom they wished to blacken, as dangerous to the
      society of which they were members. The curse, however, of these secret
      confederacies, and indeed of ribbonism in general, is, that the savage
      principle of personal vengeance is transferred from the nocturnal assault,
      or the midday assassination, which may be directed against religious or
      political enemies, to the private bickerings and petty jealousies that
      must necessarily occur in a combination of ignorant and bigoted men, whose
      passions are guided by no principle but one of practical cruelty. This
      explains, as we have just put it, and justly put it, the incredible number
      of murders which are committed in this unhappy country, under the name of
      way-layings and midnight attacks, where the offence that caused them
      cannot be traced by society at large, although it is an incontrovertible
      fact, that to all those who are connected with ribbonism, in its varied
      phases, it often happens that the projection of such murders is known for
      weeks before they are perpetrated. The wretched assassin who murders a man
      that has never offended him personally, and who suffers himself to become
      the instrument of executing the hatred which originates from a principle
      of general enmity again a class, will not be likely, once his hands are
      stained with blood, to spare any one who may, by direct personal injury,
      incur his resentment. Every such offence, where secret societies are
      concerned, is made a matter of personal feeling and trial of strength
      between factions, and of course a similar spirit is superinduced among
      persons of the same creed and principles to that which actuates them
      against those who differ from them in politics and religion. It is true
      that the occurrence of murders of this character has been referred to as a
      proof that secret societies are not founded or conducted upon a spirit of
      religious rancor; but such an assertion is, in some cases, the result of
      gross ignorance, and, in many more, of far grosser dishonesty. Their
      murdering each other is not at all a proof of any such thing, but it, is a
      proof, as we have said, that their habit of taking away human life, and
      shedding human blood upon slight grounds or political feelings, follows
      them from their conventional principles to their private resentments, and
      is, therefore, such a consequence as might naturally be expected to result
      from a combination of men who, in one sense, consider murder no crime.
      Thus does this secret tyranny fall back upon society, as well as upon
      those who are concerned in it, as a double curse; and, indeed, we believe
      that even the greater number of these unhappy wretches whom it keeps
      within its toils, would be glad if the principle were rooted out of the
      country forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; so you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to put my father down on the black list,&rdquo; said the
      beetle-browed son of the Rouser. &ldquo;Very well, Bartle, do so; but do you see
      that?&rdquo; he added, pointing to the sign of the coffin and the cross-bones,
      which he had previously drawn upon the slate; &ldquo;dhav a sphirit Neev, if you
      do, you&rsquo;ll waken some mornin&rsquo; in a warmer counthry than Ireland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Bartle, quietly, but evidently shrinking from a threat
      nearly as fearful, and far more daring than his own. &ldquo;You know I have
      nothin&rsquo; to do except my duty. Yez are goin&rsquo; aginst the cause, an&rsquo; I must
      report yez; afther whatever happens, won&rsquo;t come from me, nor from any one
      here. It is from thim that&rsquo;s in higher quarters you&rsquo;ll get your doom, an&rsquo; 
      not from me, or, as I said afore, from any one here. Mark that; but indeed
      you know it as well as I do, an&rsquo; I believe, Rouser, a good deal bether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flanagan&rsquo;s argument, to men who understood its dreadful import, was one
      before which almost every description of personal courage must quail.
      Persons were then present, Rouser Redhead among the rest, who had been
      sent upon some of those midnight missions, which contumacy against the
      system, when operating in its cruelty, had dictated. Persons of humane
      disposition, declining to act on these sanguinary occasions, are generally
      the first to be sacrificed, for individual life is nothing when
      obstructing the propagation of general principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      This truth, coming from Flanagan&rsquo;s lips, they themselves, some of whom had
      executed its spirit, knew but too well. The difference, however, between
      their apprehension, so far as they were individually concerned, was not
      much; Flanagan had the person to fear, and his opponents the principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Redhead, however, who knew that whatever he had executed upon delinquents
      like himself, might also upon himself be visited in his turn, saw that his
      safest plan for the present was to submit; for indeed the meshes of the
      White-boys&rsquo; system leave no man&rsquo;s life safe, if he express hostile
      opinions to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bartle,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you know I&rsquo;m no coward; an&rsquo; I grant that you&rsquo;ve a long
      head at plannin&rsquo; anything you set about. I don&rsquo;t see, in the mane time,
      why, afther all, we should quarrel. You know me, Bartle; an&rsquo; if anything
      happens me, it won&rsquo;t be for nothin. I say no more; but I say still that
      you throw the danger upon uz, and don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rouser Redhead,&rdquo; said Bartle, &ldquo;give me jour hand. I say now, what I
      didn&rsquo;t wish to say to-night afore, by Japurs, you&rsquo;re worth five men; an&rsquo; 
      I&rsquo;ll tell you all, boys, you must meet the Rouser here to-morrow night,
      an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll have a dhrink at my cost; an&rsquo;, boys&mdash;Rouser, hear me&mdash;you
      all know your oaths; we&rsquo;ll do something to-morrow night&mdash;an&rsquo; I say
      again, Rouser, I&rsquo;ll be wid yez an&rsquo; among yez; an&rsquo; to prove my opinion of
      the Rouser, I&rsquo;ll allow him to head us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo;, by the cross o&rsquo; Moses, I&rsquo;ll do it in style,&rdquo; rejoined the hot-headed
      but unthinking fellow, who did not see that the adroit captain was placing
      him in the post of danger. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a damn what it is&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
      meet here to-morrow night, boys, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll show you that I can lead as well
      as folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever happens,&rdquo; said Bartle, &ldquo;we oughtn&rsquo;t to have any words or
      bickerin&rsquo;s among ourselves at any rate. I undherstand that two among yez
      sthruck one another. Sure yez know that there&rsquo;s not a blow ye giv to a
      brother but&rsquo;s a perjury&mdash;an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s no use in that, barin an&rsquo; to
      help forid the thruth. I&rsquo;ll say no more about it now; but I hope there&rsquo;ll
      never be another blow given among yez. Now, get a hat, some o&rsquo; yez, till
      we draw cuts for six that I want to beat Tom Lynchagan, of Lisdhu; he&rsquo;s
      worken for St. Ledger, afther gettin&rsquo; two notices. He&rsquo;s a quiet, civil
      man, no doubt; but that&rsquo;s not the thing. Obadience, or where&rsquo;s the use of
      our meetin&rsquo;s at all? Give him a good sound batin&rsquo;, but no further&mdash;break
      no bones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then marked slips of paper, equal in number to those who were present,
      with the numbers 1, 2, 3, &amp;c, to correspond, after which he determined
      that the three first numbers and the three last should go&mdash;all of
      which was agreed to without remonstrance, or any apparent show of
      reluctance whatever. &ldquo;Now, boys,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t forget to attend
      to-morrow night; an&rsquo; I say to every man of you, as Darby Spaight said to
      the divil, when he promised to join the rebellion, <i>&lsquo;phe dha phecka
      laght,&rsquo;</i> (bring your pike with you,) bring the weapon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An who&rsquo;s the purty girl that&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to wet you, Captain Bartle?&rdquo;
       inquired Dandy Duffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The purtiest girl in this parish, anyhow,&rdquo; replied Flanagan, unawares.
      The words, however, were scarcely out of his lips, when he felt that he
      had been indiscreet. He immediately added&mdash;&ldquo;that is, if she is of
      this parish; but I didn&rsquo;t say she is. Maybe We&rsquo;ll have to thravel a bit to
      find her out, but come what come may, don&rsquo;t neglect to be all here about
      half-past nine o&rsquo;clock, wid your arms an&rsquo; ammunition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Duffy, who had sat beside Ned M&rsquo;Cormiek during the night, gave him a
      significant look, which the other, who had, in truth, joined himself to
      Flanagan&rsquo;s lodge only to watch his movements, as significantly returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the men deputed to beat Lynchaghan had blackened their faces, the
      lodge dispersed for the night, Dandy Duffy and Ned M&rsquo;Cormick taking their
      way home together, in order to consider of matters, with which the reader,
      in due time, shall be made acquainted.

    <h2>
      PART VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Our readers may recollect, that, at the close of that part of our tale
      which appeared in the preceding number, Dandy Duffy and Ned M&rsquo;Cormick
      exchanged significant glances at each other, upon Flanagan&rsquo;s having
      admitted unawares that the female he designed to take away on the
      following night was &ldquo;the purtiest girl in the parish.&rdquo; The truth was, he
      imagined at the moment that his designs were fully matured, and in the
      secret vanity, or rather, we should say, in the triumphant villainy of his
      heart, he allowed an expression&rsquo; to incautiously pass his lips which was
      nearly tantamount to an admission of Una&rsquo;s name. The truth of this he
      instantly felt. But even had he not, by his own natural sagacity,
      perceived it, the look of mutual intelligence which his quick and
      suspicious eye observed to pass between Duffy and Ned M&rsquo;Cormick would at
      once have convinced him. Una was not merely entitled to the compliment so
      covertly bestowed upon her extraordinary personal attractions, but in
      addition it might have been truly affirmed that neither that nor any
      adjoining parish could produce a female, in any rank, who could stand on a
      level with her in the character of a rival beauty. This was admitted by
      all who had ever seen the <i>colleen dhan dhun</i>, or &ldquo;the purty brown
      girl,&rdquo; as she was called, and it followed as a matter of course, that
      Flanagan&rsquo;s words could imply no other than the Bodagh&rsquo;s daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is unnecessary to say, that Flanagan,&mdash;knowing this as he did,
      could almost have bit a portion of his own tongue off as a punishment for
      its indiscretion. It was then too late, however, to efface the impression
      which the words were calculated to make, and he felt besides that he would
      only strengthen the suspicion by an over-anxiety to remove it. He,
      therefore, repeated his orders respecting the appointed meeting on the
      following night, although he had already resolved in his own mind to
      change the whole plan of his operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the precaution with which this cowardly but accomplished
      miscreant proceeded towards the accomplishment of his purposes, and such
      was his apprehension lest the premature suspicion of a single individual
      might by contingent treachery defeat his design, or affect his personal
      safety. He had made up his mind to communicate the secret of his
      enterprise to none until the moment of its execution; and this being
      accomplished, his ultimate plans were laid, as he thought, with sufficient
      skill to baffle pursuit and defeat either the malice of his enemies or the
      vengeance of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had they left the schoolhouse than the Dandy and M&rsquo;Cormick
      immediately separated from the rest, in order to talk over the proceedings
      of the night, with a view to their suspicions of the &ldquo;Captain.&rdquo; They had
      not gone far, however, when they were overtaken by two others, who came up
      to them at a quick, or, if I may be allowed the expression, an earnest
      pace. The two latter were Rousin Redhead and his son, Corney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, boys,&rdquo; said the Rouser, &ldquo;what do you think of our business to-night?
      Didn&rsquo;t I get well out of his clutches?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be me troth, Rouser, darlin&rsquo;,&rdquo; replied the Dandy, &ldquo;you niver wor
      completely in them till this minnit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Dhar ma lham charth</i>,&rdquo; said Corney, &ldquo;I say he&rsquo;s a black-hearted
      villin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how am I in his clutches, Dandy?&rdquo; inquired the Rouser.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; rejoined Duffy, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t you see that for all you said about his
      throwin&rsquo; the post of danger on other people, he&rsquo;s givin&rsquo; it to you
      to-morrow night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rousin Redhead stood still for nearly half a minute without uttering a
      syllable; at length he seized Dandy by the arm, which he pressed with the
      gripe of Hercules, for he was a man of huge size and strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Chorp ad dioual</i>, you giant, is it my arm you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to break?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be the tarnal primmer, Dandy Duffy, but I see it now!&rdquo; said the Rouser,
      struck by Bartle&rsquo;s address, and indignant at the idea of having been
      overreached by him. &ldquo;Eh, Corney,&rdquo; he continued, addressing the son,
      &ldquo;hasn&rsquo;t he the Rouser set? I see, boys, I see. I&rsquo;m a marked man wid him,
      an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s likely, for all he said, will be on the black list afore he
      sleeps. Well, Corney avic, you an&rsquo; others know how to act if anything
      happens me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; said M&rsquo;Cormick, who was a lad of considerable
      penetration, &ldquo;that you need be afeard of either him or the black list. Be
      me sowl, I know the same Bartle well, an&rsquo; a bigger coward never put a coat
      on his back. He got as pale as a sheet, to-night, when Corney there
      threatened him; not but he&rsquo;s desateful enough I grant, but he&rsquo;d be a
      greater tyrant only that he&rsquo;s so hen-hearted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what job,&rdquo; said the rouser, &ldquo;has he for us to-morrow night, do you
      think? It must be something past the common. Who the <i>dioual</i> can he
      have in his eye to run away wid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the the purtiest girl in the parish, Rouser?&rdquo; asked Ned. &ldquo;I thought
      every one knew that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you don&rsquo;t mane for to say,&rdquo; replied Redhead, &ldquo;that he&rsquo;d have the
      spunk in him to run away with Bodagh Buie&rsquo;s daughter? Be the contents o&rsquo; 
      the book, if I thought he&rsquo;d thry it, I stick to him like a Throjan; the
      dirty Bodagh, that, as Larry Lawdher said tonight, never backed or
      supported us, or gev a single rap to help us, if a penny &lsquo;ud save us from
      the gallis. To hell&rsquo;s delights wid him an&rsquo; all belongin&rsquo; to him, I say
      too; an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll tell you What it is, boys, if Flanagan has the manliness to
      take away his daughter, I&rsquo;ll be the first to sledge the door to pieces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Dhar a spiridh</i>, an&rsquo; so will I,&rdquo; said the young beetle-browed tiger
      beside him; &ldquo;thim that can an&rsquo; won&rsquo;t help on the cause, desarves no mercy
      from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus spoke from the lips of ignorance and brutality that <i>esprit de
      corps</i> of blood, which never scruples to sacrifice all minor
      resentments to any opportunity of extending the cause, as it is termed, of
      that ideal monster, in the promotion of which the worst principles of our
      nature, still most active, are sure to experience the greatest glut of low
      and gross gratification. Oh, if reason, virtue, and true religion, were
      only as earnest and vigorous in extending their own cause, as ignorance,
      persecution, and bigotry, how soon would society present a different
      aspect! But, unfortunately, they cannot stoop to call in the aid of
      tyranny, and cruelty, and bloodshed, nor of the thousand other atrocious
      allies of falsehood and dishonesty, of which ignorance, craft, and
      cruelty, never fail to avail themselves, and without which they could not
      proceed successfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      M&rsquo;Cormick, having heard Rousin Redhead and his son utter such sentiments,
      did not feel at all justified in admitting them to any confidence with
      himself or Duffy. He accordingly replied with more of adroitness than of
      candor to the savage sentiments they expressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, you&rsquo;re right, Rouser; he&rsquo;d never have spunk, sure enough, to carry
      off the Bodagh&rsquo;s daughter. But, in the mane time, who was spakin&rsquo; about
      her? Begor, if I thought he had the heart I&rsquo;d&mdash;but he hasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know he hasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the Rouser.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s nothing but a white-livered dog,&rdquo; said Duffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought, to tell you the truth,&rdquo; said M&rsquo;Cormick, &ldquo;that you might give a
      guess as to the girl, but for the Bodagh&rsquo;s daughter, he has not the mettle
      for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he had,&rdquo; replied the Rouser, &ldquo;he might count upon Corney an&rsquo; myself as
      right-hand men. We all have a crow to pluck wid the dirty Bodagh, an&rsquo;, be
      me zounds, it&rsquo;ll puzzle him to find a bag to hould the feathers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One &lsquo;ud think he got enough,&rdquo; observed M&rsquo;Cormick, &ldquo;in the loss of his
      haggard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that didn&rsquo;t come from uz,&rdquo; said the Rouser; &ldquo;we have our share to
      give him yet, an&rsquo; never fear hell get it. We&rsquo;ll taich him to abuse us, an&rsquo; 
      set us at defiance, as he&rsquo;s constantly doin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Rouser,&rdquo; said M&rsquo;Cormick, who now felt anxious to get rid of him,
      &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll be wishin&rsquo; you a good night; we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to have a while of a <i>kailyeah</i>
      (An evening conversational visit) up at my uncle&rsquo;s. Corney, my boy, good
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night kindly, boys,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;an&rsquo; __banaght lath any
      how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rouser, you divil,&rdquo; said the Dandy, calling after them, &ldquo;will you an&rsquo; 
      blessed Corney there, offer up a Patthernavy for my conversion, for I&rsquo;m
      sure that both your prayers will go far?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rousin Redhead and Corney responded to this with a loud laugh, and a
      banter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay, Dandy; but, be me sowl, if they only go as far as your own
      goodness sint you before now, it&rsquo;ll be seven years before they come back
      again; eh, do you smell anything?&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The big boshthoon hot me fairly, begad,&rdquo; observed the Dandy. Aside&mdash;&ldquo;The
      divil&rsquo;s own tongue he has.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad cess to you for a walkin&rsquo; bonfire, an&rsquo; go home,&rdquo; replied the Dandy;
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a match for you wid the tongue, at all at all&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nor wid anything else, barrin&rsquo; your heels,&rdquo; replied the Rouser; &ldquo;or
      your hands, if there was a horse in the way. Arrah, Dandy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you graceful youth, well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to be a good workman by this time; you first lamed your thrade,
      an&rsquo; thin you put in your apprenticeship&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, an&rsquo; Rouser I can promise you a merry end, my beatity; you&rsquo;ll be
      the only man that&rsquo;ll dance at your own funeral; an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll tell you what,
      Rouser, it&rsquo;ll be like an egg-hornpipe, wid your eyes covered. That&rsquo;s what
      I call an active death, avouchal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, an&rsquo; if you wor a priest, Dandy, you&rsquo;d never die with your face to
      the congregation. You&rsquo;ll be a rope-dancer yourself yet; only this, Dandy,
      that you&rsquo;ll be undher the rope instead of over it, so good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rouser,&rdquo; exclaimed the other. &ldquo;Rousin Redhead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go home,&rdquo; replied the Rouser. &ldquo;Good night, I say; you&rsquo;ve thravelled a
      great deal too far for an ignorant man like me to stand any chance wid
      you. Your tongue&rsquo;s lighter than your hands (In Ireland, to be light&mdash;handed
      signifies to be a thief) even, and that&rsquo;s payin&rsquo; it a high compliment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divil sweep you, Brien,&rdquo; said Dandy, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d beat the divil an&rsquo; Docthor
      Fosther, Good night again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ma bannaght laht, I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they accordingly parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Ned, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s to be done Dandy? As sure as gun&rsquo;s iron, this
      limb of hell will take away the Bodagh&rsquo;s daughter, if we don&rsquo;t do
      something to prevent it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not puttin&rsquo; it past him,&rdquo; returned his companion, &ldquo;but how to prevent
      it is the thing. He has the boys all on his side, barrin&rsquo; yourself and me,
      an&rsquo; a few more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; you see, Ned, the Bodagh is so much hated, that even some of thim
      that don&rsquo;t like Flanagan, won&rsquo;t scruple to join him in this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; if we were known to let the cat out o&rsquo; the bag to the Bodagh, we
      might as well prepare our coffins at wanst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, sure enough&mdash;that&rsquo;s but gospel, Ned,&rdquo; replied the Dandy;
      still it &lsquo;ud be the <i>milliah</i> murdher to let the double-faced villin
      carry off such a girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what you&rsquo;ll do, thin, Dandy,&rdquo; rejoined Ned, &ldquo;what if you&rsquo;d
      walk down wid me as far as the Bodagh&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For why? Sure they&rsquo;re in bed now, man alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; said M&rsquo;Cormick; &ldquo;but how&mdash;an&mdash;ever, if you come
      down wid me that far, I&rsquo;ll conthrive to get in somehow, widout wakenin&rsquo; 
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dickens you will! How, the sarra, man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matther, I will; an&rsquo; you see,&rdquo; he added, pulling out a flask of
      spirits, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not goin&rsquo; impty-handed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; exclaimed Duffy, &ldquo;is it there you are?&mdash;oh, that indeed!
      Faith I got a whisper of it some time ago, but it wint out o&rsquo; my head.
      Biddy Nulty, faix&mdash;a nate clane girl she is, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not the best of it, Dandy. Sure, blood alive, I can tell you a
      sacret&mdash;may dipind? Honor bright! The Bodagh&rsquo;s daughter, man, is to
      give her a portion, in regard to her bein&rsquo; so thrue to Connor O&rsquo;Donovan.
      Bad luck to the oath she&rsquo;d swear aginst him if they&rsquo;d made a queen of her,
      but outdone the counsellors and lawyers, an&rsquo; all the whole bobbery o&rsquo; 
      them, whin they wanted her to turn king&rsquo;s evidence. Now, it&rsquo;s not but I&rsquo;d
      do anything to serve the purty Bodagh&rsquo;s daughter widout it; but you see,
      Dandy, if white-liver takes her off, I may stand a bad chance for the
      portion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say no more; I&rsquo;ll go wid you; but how will you get in, Ned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never you mind that; here, take a pull out of this flask before you go
      any further. Blood an&rsquo; flummery! what a night; divil a my finger I can see
      before me. Here&mdash;where&rsquo;s your hand?&mdash;that&rsquo;s it; warm your heart,
      my boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You intind thin, Ned, to give Biddy the hard word about Flanagan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, to bid her put them on their guard; sure there can be no harm in
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say, Ned, it&rsquo;s not safe to trust a woman; what if you&rsquo;d ax to see
      the Bodagh&rsquo;s son, the young soggarth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d trust my life to Biddy&mdash;she that was so honest to the Donovans
      wouldn&rsquo;t be desateful to her sweetheart that&mdash;he&mdash;hem&mdash;she&rsquo;s
      far gone in consate wid&mdash;your sowl. Her brother Alick&rsquo;s to meet me at
      the Bodagh&rsquo;s on his way from their lodge, for they hould a meetin to-night
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never say it again. I&rsquo;ll stick to you; so push an, for it&rsquo;s late. You&rsquo;ll
      be apt to make up the match before you part, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That won&rsquo;t be hard to do any time, Dandy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both then proceeded down the same field, which we have already said was
      called the Black Park, in consequence of its dark and mossy soil. Having,
      with some difficulty, found the stile at the lower end of it, they passed
      into a short car track, which they were barely able to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night, considering that it was the month of November, was close and
      foggy&mdash;such as frequently follows a calm day of incessant rain. The
      bottoms were plashing, the drams all full, and the small rivulets and
      streams about the country were above their hanks, whilst the larger rivers
      swept along with the hoarse continuous murmurs of an unusual flood. The
      sky was one sheet of blackness&mdash;for not a cloud could be seen, or
      anything, except the passing gleam of a cottage taper, lessened by the
      haziness of the night into a mere point of faint light, and thrown by the
      same cause into a distance which appeared to the eye much more remote than
      that of reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      After having threaded their way for nearly a mile, the water spouting
      almost at every step up to their knees, they at length came to an old
      bridle&mdash;way, deeply shaded with hedges on each side. They had not
      spoken much since the close of their last dialogue; for, the truth is,
      each had enough to do, independently of dialogue, to keep himself out of
      drains and quagmires. An occasional &ldquo;hanamondioul, I&rsquo;m into the hinches;&rdquo;
       &ldquo;holy St. Peter, I&rsquo;m stuck;&rdquo; &ldquo;tun&mdash;dher an&rsquo; turf, where are you at
      all?&rdquo; or, &ldquo;by this an&rsquo; by that, I dunno where I am,&rdquo; were the only words
      that passed between them, until they reached the little road we are
      speaking, of, which, in fact, was one unbroken rut, and on such a night
      almost impassable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said M&rsquo;Cormick, &ldquo;we musn&rsquo;t keep this devil&rsquo;s gut, for conshumin&rsquo; to
      the shoe or stockin&rsquo; ever we&rsquo;d bring out of it; however, do you folly me,
      Dandy, and there&rsquo;s no danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can do nothing else,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;for I know no more where I am
      than the man of the moon, who, if all&rsquo;s thrue that&rsquo;s sed of him, is the
      biggest blockhead alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M&rsquo;Cormick, who knew the path well, turned off the road into a pathway that
      ran inside the hedge and along the fields, but parallel with the muddy
      boreen in question. They now found themselves upon comparatively clear
      ground, and, with the exception of an occasional slip or two, in
      consequence of the heavy rain, they had little difficulty in advancing. At
      this stage of their journey not a light was to be seen nor a sound of life
      heard, and it was evident that the whole population of the neighborhood
      had sunk to rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where will this bring us to, Ned?&rdquo; asked the Dandy&mdash;&ldquo;I hope we&rsquo;ll
      soon be at the Bodagh&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M&rsquo;Cormick stood and suddenly pressed his arm, &ldquo;Whisht!&rdquo; said he, in an
      under-tone, &ldquo;I think I hard voices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the other in the same low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I did,&rdquo; said Ned, &ldquo;take my word for it, there&rsquo;s people before us
      on the boreen&mdash;whisht!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They both listened, and very distinctly heard a confused but suppressed
      murmur of voices, apparently about a hundred yards before them on the
      little bridle&mdash;way. Without uttering a word they both proceeded as
      quietly and quickly as possible, and in a few minutes nothing separated
      them but the hedge. The party on the road were wallowing through the mire
      with great difficulty, many of them, at the same time, bestowing very
      energetic execrations upon it and upon those who suffered it to remain in
      such a condition. Even oaths, however, were uttered in so low and cautious
      a tone, that neither M&rsquo;Cormick nor the Dandy could distinguish their
      voices so clearly as to recognize those who spoke, supposing that they had
      known them. Once or twice they heard the clashing of arms or of iron
      instruments of some sort, and it seemed to them that the noise was
      occasioned by the accidental jostling together of those who carried them.
      At length they heard one voice exclaim rather testily. &ldquo;D&mdash;n your
      blood, Bartle Flanagan, will you have patience till I get my shoe out o&rsquo; 
      the mud&mdash;you don&rsquo;t expect me to lose it, do you? We&rsquo;re not goin&rsquo; to
      get a purty wife, whatever you may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reply to this was short, but pithy&mdash;&ldquo;May all the divils in hell&rsquo;s
      fire pull the tongue out o&rsquo; you, for nothin&rsquo; but hell itself, you villin,
      timpted me to bring you with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was not intended to be heard, nor was it by the person against whom
      it was uttered, he being some distance behind&mdash;but as Ned and his
      companion were at that moment exactly on the other side of the hedge, they
      could hear the words of this precious soliloquy&mdash;for such it was&mdash;delivered
      as they were with a suppressed energy of malignity, worthy of the heart
      which suggested them.
    </p>
    <p>
      M&rsquo;Cormick immediately pulled Duffy&rsquo;s coat, without speaking a word, as a
      hint to follow him with as little noise as possible, which he did, and ere
      many minutes they were so far in advance of the others, as to be enabled
      to converse without being heard. &ldquo;<i>Thar Bheah</i> Duffy,&rdquo; said his
      companion, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s not a minute to be lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not,&rdquo; replied the other&mdash;&ldquo;but what will you do with me?
      I&rsquo;ll lend a hand in any way I can&mdash;but remember that if we&rsquo;re seen,
      or if it&rsquo;s known that we go against them in this&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re gone men; still we must manage it
      somehow, so as to save the girl; God! if it was only on Connor O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s
      account, that&rsquo;s far away this night, I&rsquo;d do it. Dandy you wor only a boy
      when Blannarhasset prosecuted you, and people pitied you at the time, and
      now they don&rsquo;t think much the worse of you for it; an&rsquo; you know it was
      proved since, that what you sed then was thrue, that other rogues made you
      do it, an&rsquo; thin lift you in the lurch. But d&mdash;n it, where&rsquo;s the use
      of all this? give me your hand, it&rsquo;s life or death&mdash;can I thrust
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;you may, Ned; do whatever you wish with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; continued Ned, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go into the house, and do you keep near to
      them without bein&rsquo; seen; watch their motions; but above all things, if
      they take her off&mdash;folly on till you see where they&rsquo;ll bring her;
      after that they can get back enough&mdash;the sogers, if they&rsquo;re a
      wantin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depind an me, Ned; to the core depind an me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had now reached the Bodagh&rsquo;s house, upon which, as upon every other
      object around them, the deep shadows of night rested heavily. The Dandy
      took up his position behind one of the porches of the gate that divided
      the little grass&mdash;plot before the hall&mdash;door and the farmyard,
      as being the most central spot, and from which he could with more ease
      hear, or as far as might be observe, the plan and nature of their
      proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at least fifteen minutes before they reached the little avenue that
      led up to the Bodagh&rsquo;s residence; for we ought to have told our readers,
      that M&rsquo;Cormick and Duffy, having taken a short path, left the others&mdash;who,
      being ignorant of it, were forced to keep to the road&mdash;considerable
      behind them. Ned was consequently from ten to fifteen minutes in the house
      previous to their arrival. At length they approached silently, and with
      that creeping pace which betokens either fear or caution, as the case may
      be, and stood outside the gate which led to the grass-plot before the
      hall-door, not more than three or four yards from the porch of the
      farm-yard gate where the Dandy stood concealed. And here he had an
      opportunity of witnessing the extreme skill with which Flanagan conducted
      this nefarious exploit. After listening for about a minute, he found that
      their worthy leader was not present, but he almost immediately discovered
      that he was engaged in placing guards upon all the back windows of the
      dwelling-house and kitchen. During his absence the following short
      consultation took place among those whom he left behind him, for the
      purpose of taking a personal part in the enterprise:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was too thrue what Rousin Redhead said to-night,&rdquo; observed one of
      them, &ldquo;he always takes care to throw the post of danger on some one else.
      Nowit&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m afeared, but as he&rsquo;s to have the girl himself, it&rsquo;s
      but fair that his own neck should run the first danger, an&rsquo; not mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all assented to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, boys,&rdquo; he proceeded, &ldquo;if yez support me, well make him head
      this business himself. It&rsquo;s his own consarn, not ours; an&rsquo; besides, as he
      houlds the Articles, it&rsquo;s his duty to lead us in everything. So I for wan,
      won&rsquo;t take away his girl, an&rsquo; himself keepin&rsquo; back. If there&rsquo;s any one
      here that&rsquo;ll take my place for his, let him now say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were all silent as to that point; but most of them said, they wished,
      at all events, to give &ldquo;the dirty Bodagh,&rdquo; for so they usually called him,
      something to remember them by, in consequence of his having, on all
      occasions, stood out against the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still it&rsquo;s fair,&rdquo; said several of them, &ldquo;that in takin&rsquo; away the colleen,
      Bartle should go foremost, as she&rsquo;s for himself an&rsquo; &lsquo;not for huz.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, you&rsquo;ll all agree to this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do, but whist&mdash;here he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Deeply mortified was their leader on finding that they had come
      unanimously to this determination. It was too late now, however, to reason
      with them, and the crime, to the perpetration of which he brought them,
      too dangerous in its consequences, to render a quarrel with them safe or
      prudent. He felt himself, therefore, in a position which, of all others,
      he did not wish. Still his address was too perfect to allow any symptoms
      of chagrin or disappointment to be perceptible in his voice or manner,
      although, the truth is, he cursed them in his heart at the moment, and
      vowed in some shape or other to visit their insubordination with
      vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such, indeed, is the nature of these secret confederacies that are opposed
      to the laws of the land, and the spirit of religion. It matters little how
      open and apparently honest the conduct of such men may be among each
      other; there is, notwithstanding this, a distrust, a fear, a suspicion,
      lurking at every heart, that renders personal security unsafe, and life
      miserable. But how, indeed, can they repose confidence in each other, when
      they know that in consequence of their connection with such systems, many
      of the civil duties of life cannot be performed without perjury on the one
      hand, or risk of life on the other, and that the whole principle of the
      combination is founded upon hatred, revenge, and a violation of all moral
      obligation?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said their leader, &ldquo;as your minds is made up, boys, follow
      me as quickly as you can, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t spake a word in your own voices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They approached the hall-door, with the exception of six, who stood
      guarding the front windows of the dwelling-house and kitchen; and, to the
      Dandy&rsquo;s astonishment, the whole party, amounting to about eighteen,
      entered the house without either noise or obstruction of any kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Japurs,&rdquo; thought he to himself, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s thraichery there, any how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This now to the Dandy was a moment of intense interest. Though by no means
      a coward, or a young fellow of delicate nerves, yet his heart beat
      furiously against his ribs, and his whole frame shook with excitement. He
      would, in truth, much rather have been engaged in the outrage, than forced
      as he was, merely to look on without an opportunity of taking a part in
      it, one way or the other. Such, at least, were his own impressions, when
      the report of a gun was heard inside the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Dhar an Iffrin</i>, thought he again, I&rsquo;ll bolt in an&rsquo; see what&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; 
      an&mdash;oh <i>ma shaght millia mattach orth</i>, Flanagan, if you spill
      blood&mdash;Jasus above! Well, any how, come or go what may, we can hang
      him for this&mdash;glory be to God!
    </p>
    <p>
      These reflections were very near breaking-forth into words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that,&rdquo; said one of the guards to another; &ldquo;he may take the
      girl away, but it&rsquo;s not the thing to murdher any one belongin&rsquo; to a dacent
      family, an&rsquo; of our own religion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s only the Bodagh got it,&rdquo; replied his comrade, who was no other
      than Micky Malvathra, &ldquo;blaizes to the hair I care. When my brother Barney,
      that suffered for <i>Caam Beal</i> (crooked mouth) Grime&rsquo;s business, was
      before his thrial, hell resave the taisther the same Bodagh would give to
      defind him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn it,&rdquo; rejoined the other, &ldquo;but to murdher a man in his bed! Why, now,
      if it was only comin&rsquo; home from a fair or market, but at midnight, an&rsquo; in
      his bed, begorra it is not the thing, Mickey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was now a pause in the conversation for some minutes; at length,
      screams were heard, and the noise of men&rsquo;s feet, as if engaged in a
      scuffle upon the stairs, for the hall-door lay open. A light, too, was
      seen, but it appeared to have been blown out; the same noise of feet
      tramping, as if still in a tumult, approached the door, and almost
      immediately afterwards Flanagan&rsquo;s party approached, bearing in their arms
      a female, who panted and struggled as if she had been too weak to shriek
      or call for assistance. The hall-door was then pulled to and locked by
      those who were outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dandy could see, by the passing gleam of light which fell upon those
      who watched beside him, that their faces were blackened, and their clothes
      covered by a shirt, as was usual with the Whiteboys of old, and for the
      same object&mdash;that of preventing&mdash;themselves from being
      recognized by their apparel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far so good,&rdquo; said Flanagan, who cared not now whether his voice was
      known or not; &ldquo;the prize is mine, boys, an&rsquo; how to bring ma colleen dhas
      dhun to a snug place, an&rsquo; a friendly priest that I have to put the knot on
      us for life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By &mdash;-,&rdquo; thought Duffy, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put a different kind of a knot on you
      for that, if I should swing myself for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They hurried onwards with as much speed as possible, bearing the fainting
      female in a seat formed by clasping their hands together. Duffy still
      stood in his place of concealment, waiting to let them get so far in
      advance as that he might dog them without danger of being heard. Just then
      a man cautiously approached, and in a whisper asked, &ldquo;Is that Dandy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is&mdash;Saver above, Ned, how is this? all&rsquo;s lost!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no&mdash;I hope not&mdash;but go an&rsquo; watch them; we&rsquo;ll folly as soon
      as we get help. My curse on Alick Nulty, he disappointed me an&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t
      come; if he had, some of the Bodagh&rsquo;s sarvant boys would be up wid us in
      the kitchen, an&rsquo; we could bate them back aisy; for Flanagan, as I tould
      you, is a dam-coward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, thin, I&rsquo;ll trace them,&rdquo; replied the other; &ldquo;but you know that in
      sich darkness as this you haven&rsquo;t a minute to lose, otherwise you&rsquo;ll miss
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go an; but afore you go listen, be the light of day, not that we have
      much of it now any way&mdash;by the vestment, Biddy Nulty&rsquo;s worth her
      weight in Bank of Ireland notes; now pelt and afther them; I&rsquo;ll tell you
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flanagan&rsquo;s party were necessarily forced to retrace their steps along the
      sludgy boreen we have mentioned, and we need scarcely say, that, in
      consequence of the charge with which they were encumbered, their progress
      was proportionally slow; to cross the fields on such a night was out of
      the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing Flanagan did, when he found his prize safe, was to tie a
      handkerchief about her mouth that she might not scream, and to secure her
      hands together by the wrists. Indeed, the first of these precautions
      seemed to be scarcely necessary, for what with the terror occasioned by
      such unexpected and frightful violence, and the extreme delicacy of her
      health, it was evident that she could not utter even a shriek. Yet, did
      she, on the other hand, lapse into fits of such spasmodic violence as,
      wrought up as she was by the horror of her situation, called forth all her
      physical energies, and literally give her the strength of three women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; observed one of the fellows, who had assisted in holding her
      down during these wild fits, &ldquo;you may talk of jinteel people, but be the
      piper o&rsquo; Moses, that same sick daughter of the Bodagh&rsquo;s is the hardiest
      sprout I&rsquo;ve laid my hands on this month o&rsquo; Sundays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May be you&rsquo;d make as hard a battle yourself,&rdquo; replied he to whom he
      spoke, &ldquo;if you wor forced to a thing you hate as much as she hates
      Bartle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May be so,&rdquo; rejoined the other, with an incredulous shrug, that seemed to
      say he was by no means satisfied by the reasoning of his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bartle now addressed his charge with a hope of reconciling her, if
      possible, to the fate of becoming united to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be at all alarmed, Miss Oona, for indeed you may take my word for
      it, that I&rsquo;ll make as good and as lovin&rsquo; a husband as ever had a purty
      wife. It&rsquo;s two or three years since I fell in consate wid you, an&rsquo; I
      needn&rsquo;t tell you, darlin&rsquo;, how happy I&rsquo;m now, that you&rsquo;re mine. I have two
      horses waitin&rsquo; for us at the end of this vile road, an&rsquo;, plase Providence,
      we&rsquo;ll ride onwards a bit, to a friend&rsquo;s house o&rsquo; mine, where I&rsquo;ve a priest
      ready to tie the knot; an&rsquo; to-morrow, if you&rsquo;re willin&rsquo;, we&rsquo;ll start for
      America; but if you don&rsquo;t like that, we&rsquo;ll live together till you&rsquo;ll be
      willin&rsquo; enough, I hope, to go any where I wish. So take heart, darlin&rsquo;,
      take heart. As for the money I made free wid out o&rsquo; your desk, it&rsquo;ll help
      to keep us comfortable; it was your own, you know, an&rsquo; who has a betther
      right to be at the spendin&rsquo; of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, which was meant for consolation, utterly failed, or rather
      aggravated the sufferings of the affrighted girl they bore, who once more
      struggled with a power that resembled the intense muscular strength of
      epilepsy, more than anything else. It literally required four of them to
      hold her down, so dreadfully spasmodic were her efforts to be free.
    </p>
    <p>
      The delay caused by those occasional workings of terror, at a moment when
      Flanagan expected every sound to be the noise of pursuit, wrought up his
      own bad passions to a furious height. His own companions could actually
      hear him grinding his teeth with vexation and venom, whenever anything on
      her part occurred to retard their flight. All this, however, he kept to
      himself, owing to the singular command he possessed over his passions.
      Nay, he undertook, once more, the task of reconciling her to the agreeable
      prospect, as he termed it, that life presented her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be as happy as the day&rsquo;s long,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;espichilly when heaven
      sends us a family; an&rsquo; upon my troth a purty mother you&rsquo;ll make? suppose,
      darlin&rsquo; love, you wondher how I got in to-night, but I tell you I&rsquo;ve my
      wits about me; you don&rsquo;t know that it was I encouraged Biddy Nulty to go
      to live wid you, but I know what I was about then; Biddy it was that left
      the door open for me, an&rsquo; that tould me the room you lay in, an&rsquo; the place
      you keep your hard goold an&rsquo; notes; I mintion these things to show you how
      I have you hemmed in, and that your wisest way is to submit without makin&rsquo; 
      a rout about it. You know that if you wor taken from me this minit, there
      &lsquo;ud be a stain upon your name that &lsquo;ud never lave it, an&rsquo; it wouldn&rsquo;t be
      my business, you know, to clear up your character, but the conthrary. As
      for Biddy, the poor fool, I did all in my power to prevint her bein&rsquo; fond
      o&rsquo; me, but ever since we two lived with the ould miser, somehow she
      couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For some time before he had proceeded thus far, there was felt, by those
      who carried their fair charge, a slight working of her whole body,
      especially of the arms, and in a moment Flanagan, who walked a little in
      advance of her, with his head bent down, that he might not be put to the
      necessity of speaking loud, suddenly received, right upon his nose, such
      an incredible facer as made the blood spin a yard out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May all the curses of heaven an&rsquo; hell blast you, for a cowardly,
      thraicherous, parjured stag! Why, you black-hearted informer, see now what
      you&rsquo;ve made by your cunnin&rsquo;. Well, we hope you&rsquo;ll keep your word&mdash;won&rsquo;t
      I make a purty mother, an&rsquo; won&rsquo;t we be happy as the day&rsquo;s long, espichilly
      when Heaven sends us a family? Why, you rap of hell, aren&rsquo;t you a
      laughing-stock this minute? An&rsquo; to go to take my name too&mdash;an&rsquo; to
      leave the guilt of some other body&rsquo;s thraichery on me, that you knew in
      your burnin&rsquo; sowl to be innocent&mdash;me, a poor girl that has only my
      name an&rsquo; good character to carry me through the world. Oh, you
      mane-sphirted, revengeful dog, for you&rsquo;re not a man, or you&rsquo;d not go to
      take sich revenge upon a woman, an&rsquo; all for sayin&rsquo; an&rsquo; puttin&rsquo; it out on
      you, what I ever an&rsquo; always will do, that struv to hang Connor O&rsquo;Donovan,
      knowin&rsquo; that it was yourself did the crime the poor boy is now sufferin&rsquo; 
      for. Ha! may the sweetest an&rsquo; bitterest of bad luck both meet upon you,
      you villin! Amin I pray this night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The scene that followed this discovery, and the unexpected act which
      produced it, could not, we think, be properly described by either pen or
      pencil. Flanagan stood with his hands alternately kept to his nose, from
      which he flung away the blood, as it sprung out in a most copious stream.
      Two-thirds, indeed we might say three-fourths of his party, were convulsed
      with suppressed laughter, nor could they prevent an occasional cackle from
      being heard, when forcibly drawing in their breath, in an effort not to
      offend their leader. The discovery of the mistake was, in itself,
      extremely ludicrous, but when the home truths uttered by Biddy, and the
      indescribable bitterness&rsquo;caused by the disappointment, joined to the home
      blow, were all put together, it might be said that the darkness of hell
      itself was not so black as the rage, hatred, and thirst of vengeance,
      which at this moment consumed Bartle Flanagan&rsquo;s heart. He who had laid his
      plans so artfully that he thought failure in securing his prize
      impossible, now not only to feel that he was baffled by the superior
      cunning of a girl, and made the laughing-stock of his own party, who
      valued him principally upon his ability in such matters; but, in addition
      to this, to have his heart and feelings torn, as it were, out of his body,
      and flung down before him and his confreres in all their monstrous
      deformity, and to be jeered at, moreover, and despised, and literally
      cuffed by the female who outreached him&mdash;this was too much; all the
      worst passions within him were fired, and he swore in his own heart a deep
      and blasphemous oath, that Biddy Nulty never should part from him unless
      as a degraded girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      The incident that we have just related happened so quickly that Flanagan&rsquo; 
      had not time to reply a single word, and Biddy followed up her imprecation
      by a powerful effort to release herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me home this minnit, you villin,&rdquo; she continued; &ldquo;now that you find
      yourself on the wrong scent&mdash;boys, don&rsquo;t hould me, nor back that
      ruffin in his villany.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hould her like hell,&rdquo; said Bartle, &ldquo;an&rsquo; tie her up wanst more; we&rsquo;ll gag
      you, too, my lady&mdash;ay, will we. Take away your name&mdash;I&rsquo;ll take
      care you&rsquo;ll carry shame upon your face from this night to the hour of your
      death. Characther indeed!&mdash;ho, by the crass I&rsquo;ll lave you that little
      of that will go far wid you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May be not,&rdquo; replied Biddy; &ldquo;the same God that disappointed you in
      hangin&rsquo; Connor O&rsquo;Donovan&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;take that;&rdquo; and as he spoke he struck the poor girl
      a heavy blow in the cheek, which cut her deeply, and for a short time
      rendered her speechless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bartle,&rdquo; said more than one of them, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s unmanly, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s conthrary
      to the regulations.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To perdition wid the regulations! Hasn&rsquo;t the vagabone drawn a pint of
      blood from my nose already?&mdash;look at that!&rdquo; he exclaimed, throwing
      away a handful of the warm gore &ldquo;hell seize her! look at that&mdash;Ho be
      the&mdash;&rdquo; He made another onset at the yet unconscious girl as he spoke,
      and would have still inflicted further punishment upon her, were it not
      that he was prevented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said several of them, &ldquo;if you wor over us fifty times you won&rsquo;t
      lay another finger on her; that&rsquo;s wanst for all, so be quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are yez threatenin&rsquo; me?&rdquo; he asked, furiously, but in an instant he
      changed his tone&mdash;&ldquo;Boys dear,&rdquo; continued the wily but unmanly villain&mdash;&ldquo;boys
      dear, can you blame me? disappointed as I am by this&mdash;by this&mdash;<i>ha
      anhien na sthreepa</i>&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; but again he checked
      himself, and at length burst out into a bitter fit of weeping. &ldquo;Look at&rsquo; 
      this,&rdquo; he proceeded, throwing away another handful of blood, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost a
      quart of it by her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be the hand af my body,&rdquo; said one of them in a whisper, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s like every
      coward, it&rsquo;s at his own blood he&rsquo;s cryin&rsquo;; be the vartue of my oath, that
      man&rsquo;s not the thing to depind on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she tied an&rsquo; gagged?&rdquo; he then inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is,&rdquo; replied those who tied her. &ldquo;It was very asy done, Bartle,
      afther the blow you hot her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t altogether out of ill&mdash;will I hot her aither,&rdquo; he replied,
      &ldquo;although, boys dear, you know how she vexed me, but you see, the thruth
      is, she&rsquo;d a&rsquo; given us a great dale o&rsquo; throuble in gettin&rsquo; her quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; you tuck the right way to do that,&rdquo; they replied ironically; and they
      added, &ldquo;Bartle Flanagan, you may thank the oaths we tuck, or be the crass,
      a single man of us wouldn&rsquo;t assist you in this consarn, afther your
      cowardly behaver to this poor girl. Takin&rsquo; away the Bodagh&rsquo;s daughter was
      another thing; you had betther let the girl go home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Biddy had now recovered, and heard this suggestion with joy, for the poor
      girl began to entertain serious apprehensions of Flanagan&rsquo;s revenge and
      violence, if left alone with him; she could not speak, however, and those
      who bore her, quickened their pace at his desire, as much as they could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bartle, artfully, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep her prisoner anyhow for this
      night. I had once a notion of marryin&rsquo; her&mdash;an&rsquo; may be&mdash;as I am
      disappointed in the other&mdash;but we&rsquo;ll think of it. Now we&rsquo;re at the
      horses and we&rsquo;ll get an faster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was indeed true.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the journey we have just described, they at length got out of the
      boreen, where, in the corner of a field, a little to the right, two
      horses, each saddled, were tied to the branch of a tree. They now made a
      slight delay until their charge should be got mounted, and were collected
      in a group on the road, when a voice called out, &ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend to the guard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morrow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morrow mornin&rsquo; to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Age are you in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The end of the fifth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Bartle, aloud; &ldquo;now, boys,&rdquo; he whispered to his own
      party, &ldquo;we must tell them good-humoredly to pass on&mdash;that this is a
      runaway&mdash;jist a girl we&rsquo;re bringin&rsquo; aff wid us, an&rsquo; to hould a hard
      cheek (*To keep it secret) about it. You know we&rsquo;d do as much for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both parties now met, the strangers consisting of about twenty men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, boys,&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the fun?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Devil a thing but a girl we&rsquo;re helpin&rsquo; a boy to take away. What&rsquo;s your
      own sport?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begorra, we wor in luck to-night; we got as party a double-barrelled gun
      as ever you seen, an&rsquo; a case of murdherin&rsquo; fine&mdash;pistols.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Success, ould heart! that&rsquo;s right; we&rsquo;ll be able to stand a tug whin the
      &lsquo;Day&rsquo; comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which of you is takin&rsquo; away the girl, boys?&rdquo; inquired one of the
      strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begad, Bartle Flanagan, since there&rsquo;s no use in hidin&rsquo; it, when we&rsquo;re all
      as we ought to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bartle Flanagan!&rdquo; said a voice&mdash;&ldquo;Bartle Flanagan, is it? An&rsquo; who&rsquo;s
      the girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blur an&rsquo; agres, Alick Nulty, don&rsquo;t be too curious, she comes from Bodagh
      Buie&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Biddy, on hearing the voice of her brother, made another violent effort,
      and succeeded in partially working the gag out of her mouth&mdash;she
      screamed faintly, and struggled with such energy that her hands again
      became loose, and in an instant the gag was wholly I removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Alick, Alick, for the love o&rsquo; God save me from Flanagan! it&rsquo;s me, your
      sisther Biddy, that&rsquo;s in it; save me, Alick, or I&rsquo;ll be lost; he has cut
      me to the bone wid a blow, an&rsquo; the blood&rsquo;s pourin&rsquo; from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her brother flew to her. &ldquo;Whisht, Biddy, don&rsquo;t be afeard!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let my party stand by me; this is the way Bartle
      Flanagan keeps his oath!&rdquo; (* One of the clauses of the Ribbon oath was,
      not to injure or maltreat the wife or sister of a brother Ribbonman.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Secure Bartle,&rdquo; said Biddy. &ldquo;He robbed Bodagh Buie&rsquo;s house, an&rsquo; has the
      money about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The horses were already on the road, but, in consequence of both parties
      filling up the passage in the direction which Bartle and nis followers
      intended taking, the animals could not be brought through them without
      delay and trouble, even had there been no resistance offered to their
      progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A robber too!&rdquo; exclaimed Nulty, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s more of his parjury to&rsquo;ards uz.
      Bartle Flanagan, you&rsquo;re a thraitor, and you&rsquo;ll get a thraitor&rsquo;s death
      afore you&rsquo;re much oulder. He&rsquo;s not fit to be among us,&rdquo; added Alick,
      addressing himself to both parties, &ldquo;an&rsquo; the truth is, if we don&rsquo;t hang or
      settle him, he&rsquo;ll some day hang us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bartle&rsquo;s no thraitor,&rdquo; said Mulvather, &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s a thraitor that says he
      is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The coming reply was interrupted by &ldquo;Boys, good night to yez;&rdquo; and
      immediately the clatter of a horse&rsquo;s feet was heard stumbling and
      floundering back along the deep stony boreen. &ldquo;Be the vestment he&rsquo;s aff,&rdquo;
       said one of his party; &ldquo;the cowardly villin&rsquo;s aff wid himself the minit he
      seen the approach of danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure enough, the bad dhrop&rsquo;s in him,&rdquo; exclaimed several on both sides.
      &ldquo;But what the h&mdash;l does he mane now, I dunna?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be only a good joke to-morrow wid him,&rdquo; observed one of them&mdash;&ldquo;but,
      boys, we must think how to manage him; I can&rsquo;t forgive him for the
      cowardly blow he hot the poor colleen here, an&rsquo; for the same rason I
      didn&rsquo;t dhraw the knot so tight upon her as I could a&rsquo; done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it you that nipped my arm?&rdquo; asked Biddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix, you may say that, an&rsquo; it was to let you know that, let him say as
      he would, after what we seen of him to-night, we wouldn&rsquo;t allow him to
      thrate you badly without marryin&rsquo; you first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The night having been now pretty far advanced, the two parties separated
      in order to go to their respective homes&mdash;Alick taking Biddy under
      his protection to her master&rsquo;s. As the way of many belonging to each lodge
      lay in the same direction, they were accompanied, of course, to the turn
      that led up to the Bodagh&rsquo;s house. Biddy, notwithstanding the severe blow
      she had got, related the night&rsquo;s adventure with much humor, dwelling upon
      her own part in the transaction with singular glee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some thraicherous villin in the Bodagh&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;be it man
      or woman; for what &lsquo;id you think but the hall-door was left lying to only&mdash;neither
      locked nor boulted. But, indeed, anyhow, it&rsquo;s the start was taken out o&rsquo; 
      me whin Ned M&rsquo;Cormick&mdash;that <i>you</i> wor to meet in our kitchen,
      Alick&mdash;throth, I won&rsquo;t let <i>Kitty Lowry</i> wait up for <i>you</i>
      so long another time.&rdquo; She added this to throw the onus of the assignation
      off her own shoulders, and to lay it upon those of Alick and Kitty. &ldquo;But,
      anyhow, I had just time to throw her clothes upon me and get into her bed.
      Be me sowl, but I acted the fright an&rsquo; sickness in style. I wasn&rsquo;t able to
      spake a word, you persave, till we got far enough from the house to give
      Miss Oona time to hide herself. Oh, thin, the robbin&rsquo; villin how he put
      the muzzle of his gun to the lock of Miss Oona&rsquo;s desk, when he couldn&rsquo;t
      get the key, an&rsquo; blewn it to pieces, an&rsquo; thin he took every fardin&rsquo; he
      could lay his hands upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then detailed her own feelings during the abduction, in terms so
      ludicrously abusive of Flanagan, that those who accompanied her were
      exceedingly amused; for what she said was strongly provocative of mirth,
      yet the chief cause of laughter lay in the vehement sincerity with which
      she spoke, and in the utter unconsciousness of uttering anything that was
      calculated to excite a smile. There is, however, a class of such persons,
      whose power of provoking laughter consists in the utter absence of humor.
      Those I speak of never laugh either at what they say themselves, or what
      any one else may say; but they drive on right ahead with an inverted
      originality that is perfectly irresistible.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must now beg the reader to accompany them to the Bodagh&rsquo;s, where a
      scene awaited them for which they were scarcely prepared. On approaching
      the house they could perceive, by the light glittering from the window
      chinks, that the family were in a state of alarm; but at this they were
      not surprised; for such a commotion in the house, after what had occurred,
      was but natural. They went directly to the kitchen door and rapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; said a voice within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Biddy; for the love o&rsquo; God make haste, Kitty, an&rsquo; open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Biddy are you? I won&rsquo;t open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Biddy Nulty. You know me well enough, Kitty; so make haste an&rsquo; open,
      Alick, mark my words,&rdquo; said she in a low voice to her brother, &ldquo;Kitty&rsquo;s
      the very one that practised the desate this night&mdash;that left the
      hall-door open. Make haste, Kitty, I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do no such thing indeed,&rdquo; replied the other; &ldquo;it was you left the
      hall-door open to-night, an&rsquo; I heard you spakin&rsquo; to fellows outside. I
      have too much regard for my masther&rsquo;s house an&rsquo; family to let you or any
      one else in to-night. Come in the mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Folly me, Alick,&rdquo; said Biddy, &ldquo;folly me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went immediately to the hall-door, and gave such a single rap with the
      knocker, as brought more than Kitty to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; inquired a voice, which she and her brother at once knew to
      be Ned M&rsquo;Cormick&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ned, for the love o&rsquo; God, let me an&rsquo; Alick in!&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;we got away
      from that netarnal villin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instantly the door was opened, and the first thing Ned did was to put his
      arms about Biddy&rsquo;s neck, and&mdash;we were going to say kiss her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saints above!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; on seeing that her face was
      dreadfully disfigured with blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; to signify,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;but thanks be to God, we got clane
      away from the villin, or be the Padheren Partha, the villin it was that
      got clane away from hus. How is Miss Oona?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She went over to a neighbor&rsquo;s house for safety,&rdquo; replied Ned, smiling,
      &ldquo;an&rsquo; will be back in a few minutes; but who do you think, above all men in
      the five quarters o&rsquo; the earth, we have got widin? Guess now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; said Biddy; &ldquo;why, I dunna, save&mdash;but no, it couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix but it could, though,&rdquo; said Ned, mistaking her, as the matter turned
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, vick na hoiah, no! Connor O&rsquo;Donovan back! Oh! no, no, Ned; that &lsquo;ud
      be too good news to be thrue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The honest lad shook his head with an expression of regret that could not
      be mistaken as the exponent of a sterling heart. And yet, that the reader
      may perceive how near akin that one circumstance was to the other in his
      mind, we have only to say, that whilst the regret for Connor was deeply
      engraven on his features, yet the expression of triumph was as clearly
      legible as if his name had not been at all mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, then, Ned?&rdquo; said Alick. &ldquo;Who the dickens is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, divil resave the other than Bartle Flanagan himself&mdash;secured&mdash;and
      the constables sent for&mdash;an&rsquo; plaze the Saver he&rsquo;ll be in the stone
      jug afore his head gets gray any how, the black-hearted villin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was even so; and the circumstances accounting for it are very simple.
      Flanagan, having mounted one of the horses, made the best of his way from
      what he apprehended was likely to become a scene of deadly strife. Such
      was the nature of the road, however, that anything like a rapid pace was
      out of the question. When he had got over about half the boreen he was
      accosted in the significant terms of the Ribbon password of that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morrow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morrow mornin&rsquo; to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah what Age may you be, neighbor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now the correct words were, &ldquo;What Age are we in?&rdquo; (* This order or throng
      of the Ages is taken from Pastorini) but they were often slightly changed,
      sometimes through ignorance and sometimes from design, as in the latter
      case less liable to remark when addressed to persons not <i>up</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the end of the Fifth,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; if you wor shakin&rsquo; hands wid a friend, how would you do it? Or stay&mdash;all&rsquo;s
      right so far&mdash;but give us a grip of your cham ahas (right hand).&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flanagan, who apprehended pursuit, was too cautious to trust himself
      within reach of any one coming from the direction in which the Bodagh
      lived. He made no reply, therefore, to this, but urged his horse forward,
      and attempted to get clear of his catechist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dhar Dhegh! it&rsquo;s Flanagan,&rdquo; said a voice which was that of Alick Nulty;
      and the next moment the equestrian was stretched in the mud, by a heavy
      blow from the but of a carbine. Nearly a score of men were immediately
      about him; for the party he met on his return were the Bodagh&rsquo;s son, his
      servants, and such of the cottiers as lived near enough to be called up to
      the rescue. On finding himself secured, he lost all presence of mind, and
      almost all consciousness of his situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gone,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a lost man; all Europe can&rsquo;t save my life. Don&rsquo;t
      kill me, boys; don&rsquo;t kill me; I&rsquo;ll go wid yez quietly&mdash;only, if I am
      to die, let me die by the laws of the land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The laws of the land?&rdquo; said John O&rsquo;Brien; &ldquo;oh, little, Bartle Flanagan,
      you respected them. You needn&rsquo; be alarmed now&mdash;you are safe here&mdash;to
      the laws of the land we will leave you; and by them you must stand or
      fall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bartle Flanagan, we need scarcely say, was well guarded until a posse of
      constables should arrive to take him into custody. But, in the mean time,
      a large and increasing party sat up in the house of the worthy Bodagh; for
      the neighbors had been alarmed, and came flocking to his aid. &lsquo;Tis true,
      the danger was now over; but the kind Bodagh, thankful in his heart to the
      Almighty for the escape of his daughter, would not let them go without
      first partaking of his hospitality. His wife, too, for the same reason,
      was in a flutter of delight; and as her heart was as Irish as her
      husband&rsquo;s, and consequently as hospitable, so did she stir about, and
      work, and order right and left until abundant refreshments were smoking on
      the table. Nor was the gentle and melancholy Una herself, now that the
      snake was at all events scotched, averse to show herself among them&mdash;for
      so they would have it. Biddy Nulty had washed her face; and,
      notwithstanding the poultice of stirabout which her mistress with her own
      hands applied to her wound, she really was the most interesting person
      present, in consequence of her heroism during the recent outrage. After a
      glass of punch had gone round, she waxed inveterately eloquent, indeed, so
      much so that the mourner, the colleen dhas dhun, herself was more than
      once forced to smile, and in some instances fairly to laugh at the odd
      grotesque spirit of her descriptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rascal was quick!&rdquo; said the Bodagh, &ldquo;but upon my credit, Biddy, you
      wor a pop afore him for all that. Divil a thing I, or John, or the others,
      could do wid only one gun an&rsquo; a case o&rsquo; pistols against so many&mdash;still
      we would have fought life or death for poor Una anyhow. But Biddy, here,
      good girl, by her cleverness and invention saved us the danger, an&rsquo; maybe
      was the manes of savin&rsquo; some of our lives or theirs. God knows I&rsquo;d have no
      relish to be shot myself,&rdquo; said the pacific Bodagh, &ldquo;nor would I ever have
      a day or night&rsquo;s pace if I had the blood of a fellow-crathur on my sowl&mdash;upon
      my sowl I wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, blood alive, masther, what could I &lsquo;a&rsquo; done only for Ned M&rsquo;Cormick,
      that gave us the hard word?&rdquo; said Biddy, anxious to transfer the merit of
      the transaction to her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, Bid,&rdquo; replied the Bodagh, &ldquo;maybe neither Ned nor yourself
      will be a loser by it. If you&rsquo;re bent on layin&rsquo; your heads together we&rsquo;ll
      find you a weddin&rsquo; present, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bedad, sir, I&rsquo;m puzzled to know how they got in so aisy,&rdquo; said Ned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That matter remains to be cleared up yet,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;There is certainly
      treachery in the camp somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am cock sure the hall&mdash;door was not latched,&rdquo; said Duffy; &ldquo;for
      they had neither stop nor stay at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a villing among us sartainly,&rdquo; observed Mrs. O&rsquo;Brien; &ldquo;for as
      heaving is above me, I locked it wid my own two hands this blessed night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it might be wid the kay, Bridget,&rdquo; said the Bodagh, laughing at
      his own easy joke; &ldquo;for you see, doors is ginerally locked wid kays&mdash;ha!
      ha! ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix, but had Oona been tuck away tonight wid that vag o&rsquo; the world, it&rsquo;s
      not laughin&rsquo; you&rsquo;d be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God, He sees, that&rsquo;s only thruth, too, Bridget,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;but still
      there&rsquo;s some rogue about the place that opened the door for the villins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Dar ma chuirp</i>, I&rsquo;ll hould goold I put the saddle on the right
      horse in no time,&rdquo; said Biddy. &ldquo;Misthress, will you call Kitty Lowry,
      ma&rsquo;am, i&rsquo; you plase? Ill do everything above boord; no behind backs for
      me; blazes to the one alive hates foul play more nor I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We ought to have observed that one of Biddy&rsquo;s peculiarities was a more
      than usual readiness at letting fly, and not unfrequently at giving an
      oath; and as her character presented a strange compound of simplicity and
      cleverness, honesty and adroitness, her master and mistress, and
      fellow-servants, were frequently amused by this unfeminine propensity. For
      instance, if Una happened to ask her, &ldquo;Biddy, did you iron the linen?&rdquo; her
      usual reply was, &ldquo;No, blast the iron, miss, I hadn&rsquo;t time.&rdquo; Of course the
      family did everything in their power to discourage such a practice; but on
      this point they found it impossible to reform her. Kitty Lowry&rsquo;s
      countenance, when she appeared, certainly presented strong indications of
      guilt; but still there was a hardness of outline about it which gave
      promise at the same time of the most intrepid assurance. Biddy, on the.
      other hand, was brimful of consequence, and a sense of authority, on
      finding that the judicial power was on this occasion entrusted chiefly to
      her hands. She rose up when Kitty entered, and stuck a pair of red
      formidable fists with great energy into her sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the raisin&rsquo; you refused to let me in
      to-night, afther gettin&rsquo; away wid my life from that netarnal blackguard,
      Bartle Flanagan&mdash;what&rsquo;s the raisin I say, ma&rsquo;am, that you kep&rsquo; me out
      afther you knewn who was in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was here visible a slight vibration of the head, rather gentle at
      the beginning, but clearly prophetic of ultimate energy, and an
      unequivocal determination to enforce whatever she might say with suitable
      action even in its widest sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; pray, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the other, for however paradoxical it may appear,
      it is an established case that in all such displays between women,
      politeness usually keeps pace with scurrility; &ldquo;An&rsquo; pray, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied
      Kitty, &ldquo;is it to the likes o&rsquo; you we&rsquo;re to say our catechize?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Biddy was resolved not to be outdone in politeness, and replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Af you plaise, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; with a courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord protect us! what will we hear next, I wondher? Well, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; Here
      her antagonist stood, evidently waiting for the onset.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear more than&rsquo;ll go down your back pleasant afore I&rsquo;ve done wid
      you, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be makin&rsquo; us long for it in the mane time, Miss Biddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t answer my question, Miss Kitty. Why did you refuse to let me
      in tonight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For good raisons&mdash;bekase I&mdash;hard you cologgin&rsquo; an&rsquo; whisperin&rsquo; 
      wid a pack of fellows without.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; have you the brass to say so, knowin&rsquo; that it&rsquo;s false an&rsquo; a lie into
      the bargain?&rdquo; (Head energetically shaken.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I the brass, is it? I keep my brass in my pocket, ma&rsquo;am, not in my
      face, like some of our friends.&rdquo; (Head shaken in reply to the action
      displayed by Kitty.)
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a sharp retort; but it was very well returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied Biddy, &ldquo;if it&rsquo;s faces you&rsquo;re spakin&rsquo; about, I
      know you&rsquo;re able to outface me any day; but whatever&rsquo;s in my face there&rsquo;s
      no desate in my heart, Miss Lowry. Put that in your pocket.&rdquo; (One
      triumphant shake of the head at the conclusion.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s as much in your heart as&rsquo;ll shame your face, yet, Miss Nulty. Put
      that in yours.&rdquo; (Another triumphant shake of the head.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God,&rdquo; retorted Biddy, &ldquo;none o&rsquo; my friends ever knewn what a shamed
      face is. I say, madam, none o&rsquo; <i>my</i> family iver wore a shamed face.
      <i>Thiguthu shin?</i>&rdquo; (Do you understand that? )
    </p>
    <p>
      This, indeed, was a bitter hit; for the reader must know that a sister of
      Lowry&rsquo;s had not passed through the world without the breath of slander
      tarnishing her fair fame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s well known your tongue&rsquo;s no slander, Biddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thin that&rsquo;s more than can be said of yours, Kitty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my sisther met with a misfortune, it was many a betther woman&rsquo;s case
      than ever you&rsquo;ll be. Don&rsquo;t shout till you get out of the wood, ma&rsquo;am. You
      dunna what&rsquo;s afore yourself. Any how, it&rsquo;s not be lettin&rsquo; fellows into the
      masther&rsquo;s kitchen whiff the family&rsquo;s in bed, an&rsquo; dhrinkin&rsquo; whiskey wid
      them, that&rsquo;ll get you through the world wid your character safe. * * * An&rsquo; 
      you&rsquo;re nothin&rsquo; but a barge, or you&rsquo;d not dhraw down my sisther&rsquo;s name that
      never did you an ill turn, whatever she did to herself, poor girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; do you dar&rsquo; for to call me a barge? * * * * Blast your insurance! be
      this an&rsquo; be that, for a farden I&rsquo;d malivogue the devil out o&rsquo; you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not puttin&rsquo; it past you, madam, you&rsquo;re blaggard enough to fight
      like a man; but we&rsquo;re not goin&rsquo; to make a blaggard an&rsquo; a bully of
      ourselves, in the mane time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      [The conversation, of which we are giving a very imperfect report, was
      garnished by both ladies with sundry vituperative epithets, which it would
      be inconsistent with the dignity of our history to record.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s bekase you haven&rsquo;t the blood of a hen in you * * * sure we know
      what you are! But howld! be me sowl, you&rsquo;re doin&rsquo; me for all that. Ah, ha!
      I see where you&rsquo;re ladin&rsquo; me; but it won&rsquo;t do, Miss Kitty Lowry. I&rsquo;ll
      bring you back to the catechize agin. You&rsquo;d light the straw to get away in
      the smoke; but you&rsquo;re worth two gone people yet, dhough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worth half a dozen o&rsquo; you, any day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as we&rsquo;re both to the fore, we&rsquo;ll soon see that. How did you know,
      my lady, that the masther&rsquo;s hall door was left open to-night? Answer me
      that, on the nail!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was what might be very properly called a knock-down blow; for if the
      reader but reflects a moment he will see that Kitty, on taxing her
      antagonist, after her rescue, with leaving it open, directly betrayed
      herself, as there was and could have been no one in the house cognizant of
      the fact at the time unless the guilty person. With this latter exception,
      Alick Nulty was the, only individual aware of it, and from whom the
      knowledge of it could come. Kitty, therefore, by her over-anxiety to
      exculpate herself from a charge which had not been made, became the
      unconscious instrument I of disclosing the fact of her having left the
      door open.
    </p>
    <p>
      This trying query, coming upon her unexpectedly as it did, threw her into
      palpable confusion. Her face became at once suffused with a deep scarlet
      hue, occasioned by mingled shame and resentment, as was at once evident
      from the malignant and fiery glare which she turned upon her querist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;do you think I&rsquo;d think it worth my while to
      answer the likes o&rsquo; you? I&rsquo;d see you farther than I could look first. You,
      indeed! faugh! musha bad luck to your impidence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, i&rsquo; you plaise, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Biddy, dropping a courtesy, that might
      well be termed the very pink of politeness&mdash;&ldquo;we hope you&rsquo;ll show
      yourself a betther Christin than to be ignorant o&rsquo; your catechize. So.
      ma&rsquo;am, if it &lsquo;ud be plaisin&rsquo; to you afore the company maybe you&rsquo;d answer
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who made you my misthress, you blaggard flipe? who gave you authority to
      ax me sich a question?&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;A fellow-servant like myself!
      to the devil I pitch you. You, indeed! Faix, it&rsquo;s well come up wid the
      likes o&rsquo; you to ballyrag over me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but ma&rsquo;am dear, will you answer&mdash;that is, i&rsquo; you plaise, for
      sure we can&rsquo;t forget our manners, you know&mdash;will you jist answer what
      I axed you? Oh, be me cowl, your face condimns you, my lady!&rdquo; said Biddy,
      abruptly changing her tone; &ldquo;it does, you yolla Mullatty, it does. You
      bethrayed the masther&rsquo;s house, an&rsquo; Miss Oona, too, you villin o&rsquo; blazes!
      If you could see your face now&mdash;your guilty face!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The spirit of her antagonist, being that of a woman, could bear no more.
      The last words were scarcely uttered, when Lowry made a spring like a
      tigress at her opponent, who, however, received this onset with a skill
      and intrepidity worthy of Penthesilea herself. They were immediately
      separated, but not until they had twisted and twined about one another two
      or three times, after which, each displayed, by way of a trophy, a copious
      handful of hair that had changed proprietor-ship during their brief but
      energetic conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to this, there were visible on Kitty&rsquo;s face five small streams
      of liquid gore, which, no doubt, would have been found to correspond with
      the red expanded talons of her antagonist.
    </p>
    <p>
      John O&rsquo;Brien then put the question seriously to Lowry, who, now that her
      blood was up, or probably feeling that she had betrayed herself, declined
      to answer it at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll answer nothin&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t like,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll not be
      ballyraged by any one&mdash;not even by you, Misther John; an&rsquo; what&rsquo;s
      more, I&rsquo;ll lave the sarvice at the shriek o&rsquo; day to-morrow. I wouldn&rsquo;t
      live in the house wid that one; my life &lsquo;udn&rsquo;t be safe undher the wan roof
      wid her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thin you&rsquo;ll get no carrecther from any one here,&rdquo; said Mrs. O&rsquo;Brien;
      &ldquo;for, indeed, any way, there was never a minute&rsquo;s peace in the kitchen
      since you came into it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divil cares,&rdquo; she replied, with a toss of her head; &ldquo;if I don&rsquo;t, I must
      only live widout it, and will, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then flounced out of the room, and kept grumbling in an insolent tone
      of voice, until she got to her bed. Alick Nulty then detailed all the
      circumstances he had witnessed, by which it appeared unquestionable that
      Kitty Lowry had been aware of Flanagan&rsquo;s design, and was consequently one
      of his accomplices. This in one sense was true, whilst in another and the
      worst they did her injustice. It is true that Bartle Flanagan pretended
      affection for her, and contrived on many occasions within the preceding
      five months, that several secret meetings should take place between them,
      and almost always upon a Sunday, which was the only day she had any
      opportunity of seeing him. He had no notion, however, of entrusting her
      with his secret. In fact, no man could possibly lay his plans with deeper
      design or more ingenious precaution for his own safety than Flanagan.
      Having gained a promise from the credulous girl to elope with him on the
      night in question, he easily induced her to leave the hall door open. His
      exploit, however, having turned out so different in its issue from that
      which Kitty expected, she felt both chagrined and confounded, and knew not
      at first whether to ascribe the abduction of Biddy Nulty to mistake or
      design; for, indeed, she was not ignorant of Flanagan&rsquo;s treacherous
      conduct to the sex&mdash;no female having ever repulsed him, whose
      character he did not injure whenever he could do so with safety. Biddy&rsquo;s
      return, however, satisfied her that Bartle must have made a blunder of
      some kind, or he would not have taken away her fellow-servant instead of
      herself; and it was the bitterness which weak minds always feel when their
      own wishes happen to be disappointed, that prompted her resentment against
      poor Biddy, who was unconsciously its object. Flanagan&rsquo;s primary intention
      was still, however, in some degree, effected, so far as it regarded the
      abduction. The short space of an hour gave him time to cool and collect
      himself sufficiently to form the best mode of action under the
      circumstances. He resolved, therefore, to plead mistake, and to produce
      Kitty Lowry to prove that his visit that night to the Bodagh&rsquo;s house was
      merely to fulfil their mutual promise of eloping together.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was the robbery staring him in the face; and how was he to
      manage that? This, indeed, was the point on which the accomplished villain
      felt by the sinking of his heart that he had overshot his mark. When he
      looked closely into it, his whole frame became cold and feeble from
      despair, the hard paleness of mental suffering settled upon his face, and
      his brain was stunned by a stupor which almost destroyed the power of
      thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this, however, availed him not. Before twelve o&rsquo;clock the next day
      informations had been sworn against him, and at the hour of three he found
      himself in the very room which had been assigned to Connor O&rsquo;Donovan,
      sinking under the double charge of abduction and robbery.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now once more did the mutability of public feeling and opinion as
      usual become apparent. No sooner had fame spread abroad the report of
      Flanagan&rsquo;s two-fold crime, and his imprisonment, than those very people
      who had only a day or two before inferred that Connor O&rsquo;Donovan was
      guilty, because his accuser&rsquo;s conduct continued correct and blameless, now
      changed their tone, and insisted that the hand of God was visible in
      Flanagan&rsquo;s punishment. Again were all the dark traits of his character
      dragged forward and exposed; and this man reminded that man, as that man
      did some other man, that he had said more than once that Bartle Flanagan
      would be hanged for swearing away an innocent young man&rsquo;s life. Such,
      however, without reference to truth or justice, is public opinion among a
      great body of the people, who are swayed by their feelings only, instead
      of their judgment. The lower public will, as a matter of course, feel at
      random upon everything, and like a fortuneteller, it will for that reason,
      and for that only, sometimes be found on the right side. From the time
      which elapsed between the period of Bartle&rsquo;s imprisonment and that of his
      trial, many strange circumstances occurred in connection with it, of which
      the public at large were completely ignorant. Bartle was now at the mercy
      of a man who had been long looked upon with a spirit of detestation and
      vengeance by those illegal confederations with which he had uniformly
      declined to associate himself. Flanagan&rsquo;s party, therefore, had now only
      two methods of serving him, one was intimidation, and the other a general
      subscription among the various lodges of the district, to raise funds for
      his defence. To both of these means they were resolved to have recourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many private meetings they held among themselves upon those important
      matters, at which Dandy Duff and Ned M&rsquo;Cormick attended, as was their
      duty; and well was it for them the part they took in defeating Bartle
      Flanagan, and serving the Bodagh and his family, was unknown to their
      confederates. To detail the proceedings of their meetings, and recount the
      savage and vindictive ferocity of such men, would be pacing the taste and
      humanity of our readers a bad compliment. It is enough to say that a fund
      was raised for Flanagan&rsquo;s defence, and a threatening notice written to be
      pasted on the Bodagh Buie&rsquo;s door&mdash;of which elegant production the
      following is a literal copy:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buddha Bee&mdash;You &lsquo;ave wan iv our boys in for abjection an&rsquo; rubbry&mdash;an&rsquo; 
      it seems is resolved to parsequte the poor boy at the nuxt &lsquo;Shizers&mdash;now
      dhis is be way av a dalikit hint to yew an&rsquo; yoos that aff butt wan spudh
      av his blud is spiled in quensequence av yewr parsequtin&rsquo; im as the
      winther&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; on an&rsquo; the wether gettin&rsquo; cowld an&rsquo; the long nights
      settin&rsquo; in yew may as well prapare yewr caughin an&rsquo; not that same remimber

    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simon Pettier Staeught.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This and several others of the same class were served upon the Bodagh,
      with the intention of intimidating him from the prosecution of Flanagan.
      They had, however, quite mistaken their man. The Bodagh, though peaceable
      and placable, had not one atom of the coward in his whole composition. On
      the contrary, he was not only resolute in resisting what he conceived to
      be oppressive or unjust, but he was also immovably obstinate in anything
      wherein he fancied he had right on his side. And even had his disposition
      been inclined to timidity or pliancy, his son John would have used all his
      influence to induce him to resist a system which is equally opposed to the
      laws of God and of man, as well as to the temporal happiness of those who
      are slaves to the terrible power which, like a familiar devil, it
      exercises over its victims under the hollow promise of protection.

    <h2>
      PART VIII. AND LAST.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As the Bodagh and his son took the usual legal steps to forward the
      prosecution, it was but natural that they should calculate upon the
      evidence of Dandy Duffy, Ned M&rsquo;Cormick, and Alick Nulty. John O&rsquo;Brien
      accordingly informed them, on the very night of the outrage, that his
      father and himself would consider them as strong evidence against Bartle
      Flanagan, and call upon them as such. This information placed these young
      men in a position of incredible difficulty and danger. They knew not
      exactly at that moment how to proceed consistently with the duty which
      they owed to society at large, and that which was expected from them by
      the dark combination to which they were united. M&rsquo;Cormick, however, begged
      of John O&rsquo;Brien not to mention their names until the day after the next,
      and told him if he could understand their reason for this request, he
      would not hesitate to comply with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      O&rsquo;Brien, who suspected the true cause of their reluctance, did not on this
      occasion press them further, but consented to their wishes, and promised,
      not to mention their names, even as indirectly connected with the outrage,
      until the time they had specified had elapsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of the following day Nogher M&rsquo;Cormick presented himself to
      the Bodagh and his son, neither of whom felt much difficulty in divining
      the cause of his visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Nogher, after the first usual civilities had passed, &ldquo;glory
      be to God, gintlemen, this is desperate fine weather for the season&mdash;barrin&rsquo; 
      the wet&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John smiled, but the plain matter-of-fact Bodagh replied,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how the devil can you call this good weather, neighbor, when it&rsquo;s
      raining for the last week, night and day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do call it good weather for all that,&rdquo; returned Nogher, &ldquo;for you ought
      to know that every weather&rsquo;s good that God sends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Bodagh, taken aback a little by the Nogher&rsquo;s piety,
      &ldquo;there&rsquo;s truth in that, too, neighbor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am right,&rdquo; said Nogher, &ldquo;an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; else than a sinful world to
      say that this is bad weather, or that&rsquo;s bad weather&mdash;bekase the
      Scriptur says, &lsquo;wo be to thee&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, pray,&rdquo; interrupted John, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s your business with my father and
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nogher rubbed down his chin very gravely and significantly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;somethin&rsquo; for your own good, gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what is that?&rdquo; said John, anxious to bring him to the point as soon
      as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth, gentlemen, is this&mdash;I&rsquo;m an ould man, an&rsquo; I hope that I
      never was found to be anything else than an honest one. They&rsquo;re far away
      this day that could give me a good carrechtur&mdash;two o&rsquo; them anyhow
      I&rsquo;ll never forget&mdash;Connor an&rsquo; his mother; but I&rsquo;ll never see them
      agin; an&rsquo; the ould man too, I never could hate him, in regard of the love
      he bore his son. Long, long was the journey he tuck to see that son, an&rsquo;,
      as he tould me the day he whint into the ship, to die in his boy&rsquo;s arms;
      for he said heaven wouldn&rsquo;t be heaven to him, if he died anywhere else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nogher&rsquo;s eyes filled as he spoke, and we need scarcely say that neither
      the Bodagh nor his son esteemed him the less for his attachment to Connor
      O&rsquo;Donovan and his family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sooner I end the business I come about to-day,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the better.
      You want my son Ned, Dandy Duffy, an&rsquo; Alick Nulty, to join in givin&rsquo; 
      evidence against blaggard Bartle Flanagan. Now the truth is, gintlemen,
      you don&rsquo;t know the state o&rsquo; the country. If they come into a court of
      justice against him, their lives won&rsquo;t be worth a traneen. Its aginst
      their oath, I&rsquo;m tould, as Ribbonmen, to prosecute one another; an&rsquo; from
      hints I resaved, I&rsquo;m afraid they can&rsquo;t do it, as I said, barrin&rsquo; at the
      risk o&rsquo; their lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;as far as I have heard, he speaks nothing but
      truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe he does not,&rdquo; rejoined the Bodagh, &ldquo;an&rsquo;, by my sowl, I&rsquo;ll be
      bound he&rsquo;s an honest man&mdash;upon my credit, I think you are,
      M&rsquo;Cormick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thankful to you, sir,&rdquo; said Nogher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m inclined to think further,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;that we have proof enough
      against Flanagan without them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thin, if you think so, John, God forbid that we&rsquo;d be the manes of
      bringin&rsquo; the young men into throuble. All I&rsquo;m sorry for is, that they
      allowed themselves to be hooked into sich a dark and murdherous piece of
      villainy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, sir, it&rsquo;s a bad business,&rdquo; said Nogher, &ldquo;but it can&rsquo;t be helped
      now; no man&rsquo;s safe that won&rsquo;t join it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, and I won&rsquo;t for one,&rdquo; replied the Bodagh, &ldquo;not but that they sent
      many a threat to me. Anything against the laws o&rsquo; the counthry is bad, and
      never ends but in harm to them that&rsquo;s consamed in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M&rsquo;Cormick,&rdquo; added the son, &ldquo;villain as Flanagan is, we shall let him once
      more loose upon society, sooner than bring the lives of your son, and the
      two other young men into jeopardy. Such, unhappily, is the state of the
      country, and we must submit to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Nogher. &ldquo;The truth is, they&rsquo;re sworn, it seems,
      not to prosecute one another, let whatever may happen; an&rsquo; any one of them
      that breaks that oath&mdash;God knows I wish they&rsquo;d think of others as
      much as they do of it&mdash;barrin&rsquo; a stag that&rsquo;s taken up, an&rsquo; kep safe
      by the Government, is sure to be knocked on the head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say no more, M&rsquo;Cormick,&rdquo; said the Bodagh&rsquo;s inestimable son, &ldquo;say no more.
      No matter how this may terminate, we shall not call upon them as
      evidences. It must be so, father,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;and God help the country in
      which the law is a dead letter, and the passions and bigoted prejudices of
      disaffected or seditious men the active principle which impresses its
      vindictive horrors upon society! Although not myself connected with them,
      I know their oath, and&mdash;but I say no more. M&rsquo;Cormick, your friends
      are safe; we shall not, as I told you, call upon them, be the result what
      it may; better that one guilty should escape, than that three innocent
      persons should suffer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nogher again thanked him, and having taken up his hat, was about to
      retire, when he paused a moment, and, after some consideration with
      himself, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a scholar, sir, an&rsquo;&mdash;but maybe I&rsquo;m sayin&rsquo; what I oughtn&rsquo;t to
      say&mdash;but sure, God knows, it&rsquo;s all very well known long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, M&rsquo;Cormick?&rdquo; asked John; &ldquo;speak out plainly; we will not feel
      offended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas only this, sir,&rdquo; continued Nogher, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an unlarned man; but he
      would write to you may be&mdash;I mane Connor&mdash;an&rsquo; if he did, I&rsquo;d be
      glad to hear&mdash;but I hope I don&rsquo;t offind you, sir. You wouldn&rsquo;t think
      of me, may be, although many and many&rsquo;s the time I nursed him on these
      knees, an&rsquo; carried him about in these arms, an he cried&mdash;ay, as God
      is my judge, he cried bitterly&mdash;when, as he said, at the time&mdash;&lsquo;Nogher,
      Nogher, my affectionate friend, I&rsquo;ll never see you more.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John O&rsquo;Brien shook him cordially by the hand, and replied&mdash;&ldquo;I will
      make it a point to let you know anything that our family may hear from
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; if you write to him, sir, just in a single line, to say that the
      affectionate ould friend never forgot him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, too, shall be done,&rdquo; replied John; &ldquo;you may rest assured of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bodagh, whose notions in matters of delicacy and feeling were rough
      but honest, now rang the bell with an uncommon, nay, an angry degree of
      violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up some spirits here, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t be asleep. You must take a glass of
      whiskey before you go,&rdquo; he said, addressing Nogher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied Nogher, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a hurry home, for I&rsquo;m <i>aff</i> my day&rsquo;s
      work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By &mdash;-, but you must,&rdquo; rejoined the
    </p>
    <p>
      Bodagh; &ldquo;and what&rsquo;s your day&rsquo;s wages?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten pence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s half-a-crown; an&rsquo; I tell you more, you must come an&rsquo; take a <i>cot&mdash;tack</i>
      undher me, and you&rsquo;ll find the change for the betther, never fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In point of fact in was so concluded, and Nogher left the Bodagh&rsquo;s house
      with a heart thankful to Providence that he had ever entered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day of Flanagan&rsquo;s trial, however, now approached, and our readers are
      fully aware of the many chances of escaping justice which the state of the
      country opened to him, notwithstanding his most atrocious villainy. As
      some one, however, says in a play&mdash;in that of Othello, we believe&mdash;&ldquo;God
      is above all,&rdquo; so might Flanagan have said on this occasion. The evidence
      of Biddy Nulty, some of the other servants, and the Bodagh, who identified
      some of the notes, was quite sufficient against him, with respect to the
      robbery. Nor was any evidence adduced of more circumstantial weight than
      Kitty Lowry&rsquo;s, who, on being satisfied of Flanagan&rsquo;s designs against Una,
      and that she was consequently no more than his dupe, openly acknowledged
      the part she had taken in the occurrences of the night on which the
      outrages were committed. This confession agreed so well with Bartle&rsquo;s
      character for caution and skill in everything he undertook, that his
      object in persuading her to leave the hall door open was not only clear,
      but perfectly consistent with the other parts of his plan. It was a
      capital crime; and when fame once more had proclaimed abroad that Bartle
      Flanagan was condemned to be hanged for robbing Bodagh Buie, they insisted
      still more strongly that the sentence was an undeniable instance of
      retributive justice. Striking, indeed, was the difference between his
      deportment during the trial, and the manly fortitude of Connor O&rsquo;Donovan,
      when standing under as heavy a charge at the same bar. The moment he
      entered the dock, it was observed that his face expressed all the
      pusillanimous symptoms of the most unmanly terror. His brows fell, or
      rather hung over his eyes, as if all their muscular power had been lost&mdash;giving
      to his countenance not only the vague sullenness of irresolute ferocity,
      but also, as was legible in his dead small eye, the cold calculations of
      deep and cautious treachery; nor was his white, haggard cheek a less
      equivocal assurance of his consummate cowardice. Many eyes were now turned
      upon him; for we need scarcely say that his part of a case which created
      so much romantic interest as the conviction of Connor O&rsquo;Donovan, and the
      history it developed of the mutual affection which subsisted between him
      and Una, was by no means forgotten. And even if it had, his present
      appearance and position would, by the force of ordinary association, have
      revived it in the minds of any then present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deprived of all moral firmness, as he appeared to be, on entering the
      dock, yet, as the trial advanced, it was evident that his heart and
      spirits were sinking still more and more, until at length his face, in
      consequence of its ghastliness, and the involuntary hanging of his
      eyebrows, indicated scarcely any other expression than that of utter
      helplessness, or the feeble agony of a mind so miserably prostrated, as to
      be hardly conscious of the circumstances around him. This was clearly
      obvious when the verdict of &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; was uttered in the dead silence which
      prevailed through the court. No sooner were the words pronounced than he
      looked about him wildly, and exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? what&rsquo;s that? Oh, God&mdash;; sweet Jasus! sweet Jasus!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His lips then moved for a little, and he was observed to mark his breast
      prvately with the sign of the cross; but in such a manner as to prove that
      the act was dictated by the unsettled incoherency of terror, and not by
      the promptings of piety or religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge now put on the black cap, and! was about to pronounce the fatal
      sentence, when the prisoner shrieked out, &ldquo;Oh, my Lord&mdash;my Lord,
      spare me! Oh, spare me, for I&rsquo;m not fit to die. I daren&rsquo;t meet God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; exclaimed the judge, &ldquo;unhappy man, it is too often true, that
      those who are least prepared to meet their Almighty Judge, are also the
      least reckless in the perpetration of those crimes which are certain, ere
      long, to hurry them into His presence. You find now, that whether as
      regards this life or the next, he who observes the laws of his religion
      and his country, is the only man who can be considered, in the true sense
      of the word, his own friend; and there is this advantage in his conduct,
      that, whilst he is the best friend to himself, it necessarily follows that
      he must be a benefactor in the same degree to society at large. To such a
      man the laws are a security, and not, as in your case, and in that of
      those who resemble you, a punishment. It is the wicked only who hate the
      laws, because they are conscious of having provoked their justice. In
      asking me to spare your life, you are aware that you ask me for that which
      I cannot grant. There is nothing at all in your case to entitle you to
      mercy; and if, by the life you have led, you feel that you are unfit to
      die, it is clear upon your own principles, and by the use you have made of
      life, that you are unfit to live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then proceeded to exhort him, in the usual terms, to sue for
      reconciliation with an offended God, through the merits and sufferings of
      Christ. After which he sentenced him to be executed on the fifth day from
      the close of the assizes. On hearing the last words of the judge, he
      clutched the dock at which he stood with a convulsive effort; his hands
      and arms, however, became the next moment relaxed, and he sank down in a
      state of helpless insensibility. On reviving he found himself in his cell,
      attended by two of the turnkeys, who felt now more alarmed at his screams
      and the horror which was painted on his face, than by the fainting fit
      from which he had just recovered. It is not our design to dwell at much
      length upon the last minutes of such a man; but we will state briefly,
      that, as might be expected, he left nothing unattempted to save his own
      life. On the day after his trial, he sent for the sheriff, and told him,
      that, provided his life were granted by the government, he could make many
      important disclosures, and give very valuable information concerning the
      state and prospects of Ribbonism in the country, together with a long list
      of the persons who were attached to it in that parish. The sheriff told
      him that this information, which might under other circumstances have been
      deemed of much value by the government, had already been anticipated by
      another man during the very short period that had elapsed since his
      conviction. There was nothing which he could now disclose, the sheriff
      added, that he himself was not already in possession of, even to the rank
      which he, Flanagan, was invested with among them, and the very place where
      he and they had held their last meeting. But, independently of that, he
      proceeded, it is not usual for: government to pardon the principals in any
      such outrage as that for which you have been convicted. I shall, however,
      transmit your proposal to the Secretary, who may act in the matter as he
      thinks proper.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime his relatives and confederates were not idle outside, each
      party having already transmitted a petition to the Castle in his behalf.
      That of his relations contained only the usual melancholy sentiments, and
      earnest entreaties for mercy, which are to be found in such documents. The
      memorial, however, of his confederates was equally remarkable for its
      perverted ingenuity, and those unlucky falsehoods which are generally
      certain to defeat the objects of those who have recourse to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It went to say that the petitioners feared very much that the country was
      in a dangerous state, in consequence of the progressive march of Ribbonism
      in parts of that parish, and in many of the surrounding districts. That
      the unhappy prisoner had for some time past made himself peculiarly
      obnoxious to this illegal class of persons; and that he was known in the
      country as what is termed &ldquo;a marked man,&rdquo; ever since he had the courage to
      prosecute, about two years ago, one of their most notorious leaders, by
      name Connor O&rsquo;Donovan, of Lisnamona; who was, at the period of writing
      that memorial, a convict during life in New South Wales, for a capital
      White-boy offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      That said Connor O&rsquo;Donovan, having seduced the affections of a young woman
      named Una O&rsquo;Brien, daughter of a man called Michael O&rsquo;Brien, otherwise
      Bodagh Buie, or the Yellow Churl, demanded her in marriage from her father
      and family, who unanimously rejected his pretensions. Upon which,
      instigated by the example and practice of the dark combination of which he
      was so distinguished a leader, he persuaded memorialist, partly by
      entreaties, but principally by awful and mysterious threats, to join him
      in the commission of this most atrocious crime. That, from the moment he
      had been forced into the participation of such an act, his conscience
      could not permit him to rest night or day; and he consequently came
      forward boldly and fearlessly, and did what he considered his duty to God
      and his country.
    </p>
    <p>
      That, in consequence of this conscientious act, O&rsquo;Donovan, the Ribbon
      ringleader, was capitally convicted; but through the interest of some
      leading gentlemen of the parish, who were ignorant of his habits and
      connections, the sentence was, by the mercy of government, commuted to
      transportation for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      That, upon his banishment from the country, the girl whose affections he
      had seduced, became deranged for some time; but, after her recovery,
      expressed, on many occasions, the most bitter determinations to revenge
      upon petitioner the banishment of her lover; and that the principal
      evidence upon which petitioner was convicted, was hers * and that of a
      girl named Bridget Kulty, formerly a servant in his father&rsquo;s house, and
      known to have been his paramour.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * This was a falsehood, inasmuch as Una, having been
     concealed in another room, could give, and did give, no
     evidence that any way affected his life.
</pre>
    <p>
      That this girl, Bridget Nulty, was taken into O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s family at the
      suggestion of his daughter Una; and that, from motives of personal hatred,
      she and Bridget Nulty, aided by another female servant of O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s named
      Kitty Lowry, formed the conspiracy of which petitioner is unhappily the
      victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      It then proceeded to detail how the conspiracy of Una O&rsquo;Brien and the two
      females she had taken in as accomplices, was carried into effect; all of
      which was done with singular tact and ingenuity; every circumstance being
      made to bear a character and design diametrically opposed to truth. It
      concluded by stating that great exultation had been manifested by the
      Ribbonmen of that parish, who, on the night of petitioner&rsquo;s conviction,
      lit bonfires in several parts of the neighborhood, fired shots, sounded
      horns, and displayed other symptoms of great rejoicing; and hoped his
      excellency would, therefore, interpose his high prerogative, and prevent
      petitioner from falling a sacrifice to a conspiracy on one hand, and the
      resentment of a traitorous confederacy on the other; and all this only for
      having conscientiously and firmly served the government of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our readers need not be surprised at the ingenuity of this plausible
      petition, for the truth is that before government supported any system of
      education at all in Ireland, the old hedge school-masters were, almost to
      a man, office-bearers and leaders in this detestable system. Such men, and
      those who were designed for the priesthood, with here and there an
      occasional poor scholar, were&rsquo; uniformly the petition writers, and,
      indeed, the general scribes of the little world in which they lived. In
      fact, we have abundance of public evidence to satisfy us, that persons of
      considerable literasy attainments have been connected with Ribbonism in
      all its stages.
    </p>
    <p>
      This fine writing, however, was unfortunately counteracted, in consequence
      of the information already laid before the sheriff by no less a personage
      than Rouser Redhead, who, fearing alike the treachery and enmity of his
      leader, resolved thus to neutralize any disclosures he should happen to
      make. But lest this might not have been sufficient to exhibit the
      character of that document, the proposal of Bartle himself to make
      disclosures was transmitted to the Secretary of State, by the same post;
      so that both reached that gentleman, <i>pari passu</i>, to his no small
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Flanagan&rsquo;s confederates consulted him, he would of course have
      dissuaded them from sending any petition at all, or at least, only such as
      he could approve of, but such is the hollowness of this bond, and so
      little confidence is placed in its obligation, that when any of its
      victims happen to find themselves in a predicament similar to Flanagan&rsquo;s,
      his companions without lead such a life of terror, and suspicion, and
      doubt, as it would be difficult to describe. But when, as in Bartle&rsquo;s
      case, there exists a strong distrust in his firmness and honesty, scarcely
      one can be found hardy enough&mdash;to hold any communication with him.
      This easily and truly accounts for the fact of their having got this
      petition written and sent to government in his name. The consequence was,
      that, on the day previous to that named for his execution, his death
      warrant reached the sheriff, who lost no time in apprising him of his
      unhappy fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a trying task to that humane and amiable gentleman, who had
      already heard of the unutterable tortures which the criminal suffered from
      the horror of approaching death, and the dread of eternity; for neither by
      penitence nor even by remorse, was he in the slightest degree moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To die!&rdquo; said he, staggering back; &ldquo;to be in eternity to-morrow! to have
      to face God before twelve o&rsquo;clock! tarrible! tar&mdash;rible! tarrible!
      Can no one save me? To die to&mdash;morrow!&mdash;tarrible!&mdash;tarrible!&mdash;tarrible!
      Oh that I could sink into the earth! that the ground &lsquo;ud swlly me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sheriff advised him to be a man, and told him to turn to God,&mdash;who,
      if he repented, would in no wise cast him out. &ldquo;Act,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as
      O&rsquo;Donovan did, whom you yourself prosecuted and placed in the very cell in
      which you now stand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor O&rsquo;Donovan!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;he might well bear to die; he was
      innocent; it was I that burned Bodagh Buie&rsquo;s haggard; he had neither act
      nor part in it no more than the child unborn. I swore away his life out of
      revinge to his father an&rsquo; jealousy of himself about Una O&rsquo;Brien. Oh, if I
      had as little to answer for now as he, I could die&mdash;die! Sweet Jasus,
      an&rsquo; must I die to-morrow&mdash;be in the flames o&rsquo; hell afore twelve
      o&rsquo;clock? tarrible! terrible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was absolutely, to use his own word, &ldquo;terrible,&rdquo; to witness the almost
      superhuman energy of his weakness. On making this last disclosure to the
      sheriff, the latter stepped back from a feeling of involuntary surprise
      and aversion, exclaiming as he did it,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, God forgive you, unhappy and guilty man! you have much, indeed, to
      answer for; and, as I said before, I advise you to make the most of the
      short time that is allotted to you, in repenting and seeking pardon from
      God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The culprit heard him not, however, for his whole soul was fearfully
      absorbed in the contemplation of eternity and punishment, and death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the turnkey, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the way he&rsquo;s runnin&rsquo; about the room
      almost since his thrial; not, to be sure, altogether so bad as now, but
      clappin&rsquo; his hands, an&rsquo; scramm&rsquo; an&rsquo; groanin&rsquo;, that it&rsquo;s frightful to
      listen to him. An&rsquo; his dhrames, sir, is worse. God, sir, if you&rsquo;d hear him
      asleep, the hair would stand on your head; indeed, one of us is ordered to
      be still with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is right,&rdquo; replied the sheriff, who, after recommending him to get a
      clergyman, left him, and, with his usual promptness and decision,
      immediately wrote to the Secretary of State, acquainting him with
      Flanagan&rsquo;s confession of his own guilt, and of Connor O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s
      innocence of the burning of O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s haggard; hoping, at the same time,
      that government would take instant steps to restore O&rsquo;Donovan to his
      country and his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after the sheriff left him, a Roman Catholic clergyman arrived, for
      it appeared that against the priest who was chaplain of the jail he had
      taken an insurmountable prejudice, in consequence of some fancied
      resemblance he supposed him to bear to the miser&rsquo;s son. The former
      gentleman spent that night with him, and, after a vast deal of exertion
      and difficulty, got him so far composed, as that he attempted to confess
      to him, which, however, he did only in a hurried and distracted manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how shall we describe the scene, and we have it from more than one or
      two witnesses, which presented itself, when the hour of his execution drew
      nigh. His cries and shrieks were distinctly heard from a considerable
      distance along the dense multitudes which were assembled to witness his
      death; thus giving to that dreadful event a character of horror so deep
      and gloomy, that many persons, finding themselves unable to bear it,
      withdrew from the crowd, and actually fainted on hearing the almost
      supernatural tones of his yells and howlings within.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time, the proceedings in the press-room were of a still more
      terrific description He now resembled the stag at bay; his strength became
      more than human. On attempting to tie his hands, five men were found
      insufficient for the woeful task. He yelled, and flung them aside like
      children, but made no attempt at escape, for, in truth, he knew not what
      he did. The sheriff, one of the most powerful and athletic men to be found
      in the province, was turned about and bent like an osier in his hands. His
      words, when the fury of despair permitted his wild and broken cries to
      become intelligible, were now for life&mdash;only life upon any terms; and
      again did he howl out his horrors of death, hell, and judgment. Never was
      such a scene, perhaps, witnessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length his hands were tied, and they attempted to get him up to the
      platform of death, but to their amazement he was once more loose, and,
      flying to the priest, he clasped him with the gripe of Hercules.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save me, save me!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Let me live! I can&rsquo;t die! You&rsquo;re puttin&rsquo; 
      me into hell&rsquo;s fire! How can I face God? No, it&rsquo;s tarrible! it&rsquo;s tarrible!
      tarrible! Life, life, life&mdash;only life&mdash;oh, only life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he pressed the reverend gentleman to his breast and kissed
      him, and shouted with a wildness of entreaty, which far transcended in
      terror the most outrageous paroxysms of insanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not lave the priest,&rdquo; shrieked he; &ldquo;so long as I stay with him so
      long I&rsquo;ll be out of the punishments of eternity. I will stick to you.
      Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t put me away, but have pity on me! No&mdash;I&rsquo;ll not go,
      I&rsquo;ll not go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he kissed his lips, cheeks, and forehead, and still clung to him
      with terrific violence, until at last his hands were finally secured
      beyond the possibility of his again getting them loose. He then threw
      himself upon the ground, and still resisted, with a degree of muscular
      strength altogether unaccountable in a person, even of his compact and
      rather athletic form. His appearance upon the platform will long be
      remembered by those who had the questionable gratification of witnessing
      it. It was the struggle of strong men dragging a strong man to the most
      frightful of all precipices&mdash;Death.

      When he was seen by the people in the act of being forced with such
      violence to the drop, they all moved, like a forest agitated by a sudden
      breeze, and uttered that strange murmur, composed of many passions, which
      can only be heard where a large number of persons are congregated together
      under the power of something that is deep and thrilling in its interest.
      At length, after a struggle for life, and a horror of death possibly
      unprecedented in the annals of crime, he was pushed upon the drop, the
      spring was touched, and the unhappy man passed shrieking into that
      eternity which he dreaded so much. His death was instantaneous, and, after
      hanging the usual time, his body was removed to the goal; the crowd began
      to disperse, and in twenty minutes the streets and people presented
      nothing more than their ordinary aspect of indifference to everything but
      their own affairs.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * We have only to say, that W&mdash;m O&mdash;k, Esq., of Jj&mdash;sb&mdash;e,
     sheriff of the county of D&mdash;n. and those who officially
     attended, about four years ago, the execution of a man named
     M&mdash;y&mdash;, at the gaol of D&mdash;rip&mdash;k, for a most heinous murder,
     will, should they happen to see this description, not
     hesitate to declare that it falls far, far short of what
     they themselves witnessed upon this terrible occasion.
     There is nothing mentioned here which did not then occur,
     but there is much omitted.
</pre>
    <p>
      Such, and so slight, after all, is the impression which death makes upon
      life, when the heart and domestic affections are not concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, gentle and patient reader&mdash;for well, indeed, has thy
      patience been tried, during the progress of this tantalizing narrative&mdash;we
      beg to assure thee, that unless thou art so exquisitely tender-hearted as
      to mourn over the fate of Bartle Flanagan, the shadows which darkened the
      morning and noon of our story have departed, and its eye will be dewy, and
      calm, and effulgent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flanagan&rsquo;s execution, like any other just and necessary vindication of the
      law, was not without its usual good effect upon the great body of the
      people; for, although we are not advocates for a sanguinary statute-book,
      neither are we the eulogists of those who, with sufficient power in their
      hands, sit calmly and serenely amidst scenes of outrage and crime, in
      which the innocent suffer by the impunity of the guilty. Fame, who is busy
      on such occasions, soon published to a far distance Flanagan&rsquo;s confession
      of having committed the crime for which O&rsquo;Donovan was punished. John
      O&rsquo;Brien had it himself! from the sheriff&rsquo;s lips, as well as from a still
      more authentic statement written by the priest who attended him, and
      signed by the unhappy culprit&rsquo;s mark, in the presence of that gentleman,
      the governor of the gaol, and two turnkeys. The sheriff now heard, from
      O&rsquo;Brien, for the first time, that O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s parents, having disposed of
      all their property, followed him to New South Wales, a circumstance by
      which he was so much struck at the moment, that he observed to O&rsquo;Brien,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not think it the duty of the Government, considering all the young
      man and his parents have suffered by that rascal&rsquo;s malice, to bring the
      whole family back at its own expense? For my part, aware as I am of the
      excellent disposition of the Secretary, I think, if we ask them, it will
      be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our best plan, perhaps,&rdquo; replied John, &ldquo;is to get a memorial to that
      effect signed by those who subscribed to the former one in his behalf. I
      think it is certainly necessary, for, to tell you the truth, I doubt
      whether they are in possession of funds sufficient for the expenses of so
      long a journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said the sheriff, &ldquo;that there is little time to be lost, for S&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo;
       naming the governor of the gaol, &ldquo;tells me that the next convict ship
      sails in a fortnight. We must, therefore, push forward the business as
      rapidly as we can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well and truly did they keep their words, for we have the satisfaction of
      adding, that on the seventh day from the date of that conversation, they
      received a communication from the Castle, informing them that, after
      having taken the peculiar hardships of O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s singular case into
      mature consideration, they deemed the prayer of the memorial such as they
      felt pleasure in complying with; and that the Colonial Secretary had been
      written to, to take the proper steps for the return of the young man and
      his parents to their own country at the expense of the Government.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was enough, and almost more than O&rsquo;Brien expected. He had now done as
      much as could be done for the present, and nothing remained but to await
      their arrival with hope and patience. In truth, the prospect that now
      presented itself to the Bodagh&rsquo;s family was one in which, for the sake of
      the beloved Una, they felt a deep and overwhelming interest. Ever since
      Connor&rsquo;s removal from the country her spirits had gradually become more
      and more depressed. All her mirth and gayety had abandoned her; she
      disrelished reading; she avoided company; she hardly ever laughed, but, on
      the contrary, indulged in long fits of bitter grief while upon her
      solitary rambles. Her chief companion was Biddy Nulty, whom she exempted
      from her usual employment whenever she wished that Connor should be the
      topic of their conversation. Many a time have they strolled together
      through the garden, where Una had often stood, and, pointing to the summer&mdash;house,
      where the acknowledgments of their affection were first exchanged, said to
      her humble companion,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Biddy, that is the spot where he first told me that he loved me, and
      where I first acknowledged mine to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She would then pull out from her heart the locket which contained his rich
      brown hair, and, after kissing it, sit and weep on the spot which was so
      dear to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biddy&rsquo;s task, then, was to recount to the unhappy girl such anecdotes as
      she remembered of him; and, as these were all to his advantage, we need
      scarcely say that many an entertainment of this kind she was called upon
      to furnish to her whose melancholy enjoyment was now only the remembrance
      of him, and what he had once been to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would have been in a convent long before now, Biddy,&rdquo; said she, a few
      days before Flanagan&rsquo;s trial, &ldquo;but I cannot leave my father and mother,
      because I know they could not live without me. My brother John has
      declined Maynooth lest I should feel melancholy for want of some person to
      amuse me and to cheer me; and now I feel that it would be an ungrateful
      return I should make if I entered a convent and left my parents without a
      daughter whom they love so well, and my brother without a sister on whom
      he doats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Miss,&rdquo; replied Biddy, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be cast down; for my part I&rsquo;d always
      hope for the best. Who knows, Miss, but a betther lave may be turned up
      for you yet? I&rsquo;d hould a naggin&rsquo; that God nivir intinded an innocent
      creature like you to spind the rest of your life in sadness and sorrow, as
      you&rsquo;re doin&rsquo;. Always hope for the best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Biddy,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know what you speak of. His sentence
      is one that can never be changed; and as for hoping for the best how can I
      do that, Biddy, when I know that I have no &lsquo;best&rsquo; to hope for. He was my
      best in this world; but he is gone. Now go in, Biddy, and leave me to
      myself for a little. You know how I love to be alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May God in heaven pity you, Miss Oona,&rdquo; exclaimed the poor girl, whilst
      the tears gushed from her eyes, &ldquo;as I do this day! Oh, keep up your heart,
      Miss, darlin&rsquo;! for where there&rsquo;s life there&rsquo;s hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Little did she then dream, however, that hope would so soon restored to
      her heart, or that the revolution of another year should see her waiting
      with trembling delight for the fulness of her happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening previous to Bartle Flanagan&rsquo;s execution, she was pouring
      out tea for her father and mother, as was usual, when her brother John
      came home on his return from the assizes. Although the smile of affection
      with which she always received him lit up her dark glossy eyes, yet he
      observed that she appeared unusually depressed, and much more pale than
      she had been for some time past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Una, are you unwell, dear?&rdquo; he asked, as she handed him a cup of tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with a kind of affectionate reproof in her eyes, as if
      she wondered that he should be ignorant of the sorrow which preyed upon
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in health, John,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;but that man&rsquo;s trial, and the many
      remembrances it has stirred up in my mind, have disturbed me. I am very
      much cast down, as you may see. Indeed, to speak the truth, and without
      disguise, I think that my heart is broken. Every one knows that a breaking
      heart is incurable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take it too much to yourself, a lanna dhas,&rdquo; said her mother; &ldquo;but
      you must keep up your spirits, darlin&rsquo;&mdash;time will work wonders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With me, mother, it never can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Una,&rdquo; said John, with affected gravity, &ldquo;you have just made two
      assertions which I can prove to be false.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;False, dear John?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, false, dear Una; and I will prove it, as I said. In the first place,
      there is a cure for a breaking&rsquo; heart; and, in the next place, time will
      work wonders even for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she, assuming a look of sickly cheerfulness, &ldquo;I should be
      very ungrateful, John, if I did not smile for you, even when you don&rsquo;t
      smile yourself, after all the ingenious plans you take to keep up my
      spirits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear girl,&rdquo; replied John, &ldquo;I will not trifle with you; I ask you now
      to be firm, and say whether you are capable of hearing&mdash;good news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good news to me! I hope I am, John.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I have to inform you that this day Bartle Flanagan has
      confessed that it was not Connor O&rsquo;Donovan who burned our haggard, but
      himself. The sheriff has written to inform the Government, so that we will
      have Connor back again with a name and character unsullied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him for a moment, then at her parents; and her cheek still
      got paler, and after a slight pause she burst into a vehement and
      irrepressible paroxysm of grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John, is this true?&rdquo; inquired his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vic va hoiah! John&mdash;blessed mother!&mdash;thrue?&mdash;but is it,
      John? is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, it is, mother&mdash;the villain, now, that he has no hope of his
      life, confessed it this day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows, darlin&rsquo;,&rdquo; exclaimed the Bodagh&rsquo;s warm&mdash;hearted wife, now
      melting into tears herself, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no wondher you should cry tears of joy
      for this. God wouldn&rsquo;t be above us, a cushla oge machree, or he&rsquo;d sind
      brighter days before your young and innocent heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Una could not speak, but wept on; the grief she felt, however, became
      gradually milder in its character, until at length her violent sobbings
      were hushed; and, although the tears still flowed, they flowed in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will have him back, sartinly,&rdquo; said the Bodagh; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t cry, dear,
      we&rsquo;ll have him here again with no disateful villain to swear away his
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could die now,&rdquo; said the noble&mdash;minded girl; &ldquo;I think I could die
      now, without even seeing him. His name is cleared, and will be cleared;
      his character untainted; and that is dearer to me even than his love. Oh,
      I knew it! I knew it!&rdquo; she fervently exclaimed; &ldquo;and when all the world
      was against him, I was for him; I and his own mother&mdash;for we were the
      two that knew his heart best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said John, smiling, &ldquo;if I brought you gloomy news once, I believe
      I have brought you pleasant news twice. You remember when I told you he
      was not to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, John, dear, you are the best brother that ever God blessed a
      sister with; but I hope this is not a dream. Oh, can it be possible! and
      when I awake in the morning, will it be to the sorrowful heart I had
      yesterday? I am bewildered. After this, who should ever despair of the
      goodness of God, or think that the trial he sends but for a time is to
      last always?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bridget,&rdquo; said the gracious Bodagh, &ldquo;we must have a glass of punch; an&rsquo; 
      upon my reputaytion, Oona, we&rsquo;ll drink to his speedy return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throth, an&rsquo; Oona will take a glass, herself, this night,&rdquo; added her
      mother; &ldquo;an&rsquo; thanks be to Goodness she&rsquo;ll be our colleen dhas dhun again&mdash;won&rsquo;t
      you have a glass, asthore machree?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do anything that any of you wishes me, mother,&rdquo; replied Una.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave, as she uttered the words, a slight sob, which turned their
      attention once more to her, but they saw at once, by the brilliant sparkle
      of her eyes, that it was occasioned by the unexpected influx of delight
      and happiness which was accumulating around her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;will you make the punch for them to&mdash;night? I
      cannot rest till I let poor Biddy Kulty know what has happened. Cleared!&rdquo;
       she added, exultingly, &ldquo;his name and character cleared!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The beautiful girl then left the room, and, short as was the space which
      had elapsed since she heard her brother&rsquo;s communication, they could not
      help being struck at the light elastic step with which she tripped out of
      it. Brief, however, as the period was, she had time to cast aside the
      burthen of care which had pressed her down and changed her easy pace to
      the slow tread of sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God help our poor colleen dhas,&rdquo; exclaimed her mother, &ldquo;but she&rsquo;s the
      happy creature, this night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And happy will the hearth be where her light will shine,&rdquo; replied her
      father, quoting a beautiful Irish proverb to that effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ways of Providence are beautiful when seen aright or understood,&rdquo;
       observed her brother. &ldquo;She was too good to be punished, but not too
      perfect to be tried. Their calamitous separation will enhance the value of
      their affection for each other when they meet; for pure and exalted as her
      love for him is, yet I am proud to say that Connor is worthy of her and
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That night her mother observed that Una spent a longer time than usual at
      her devotions, and, looking into her room when passing, she saw her on her
      knees, and heard her again sobbing with the grateful sense of a delighted
      heart. She did not again address her, and they all retired to happier
      slumbers than they had enjoyed for many a night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our readers have already had proofs of Una&rsquo;s consideration, generosity,
      and common delicacy. Her conduct at the approach of her lover&rsquo;s trial, and
      again when he was about to leave her and his country forever, they cannot,
      we are sure, have forgotten. When her brother had shown the official
      communication from the Castle, in which government expressed its intention
      of bringing Connor and his parent&rsquo;s home at its own expense, the Bodagh
      and his wife,&mdash;knowing that the intended husband of their daughter
      possessed no means of supporting her, declared, in order to remove any
      shadow of anxiety from her mind, that O&rsquo;Donovan, after their marriage,
      should live with themselves, for they did not wish, they said, that Una
      should be separated from them. This was highly gratifying to her, but
      beyond her lover&rsquo;s welfare, whether from want of thought or otherwise, it
      is not easy to say, she saw that their sympathy did not extend. This
      troubled her, for she knew how Connor loved his parents, and how much any
      want of comfort they might feel would distress him. She accordingly
      consulted with her ever faithful confidant, John, and begged of him to
      provide for them, at her own expense, a comfortable dwelling, and to
      furnish it, as near as might be practicable in the manner in which their
      former one had been furnished. She also desired him to say nothing to
      their parents about this, &ldquo;for I intend,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;to have a little
      surprise for them all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      About the time, therefore, when the vessel in which they were to arrive
      was expected, a snug, well&mdash;furnished house, convenient to the
      Bodagh&rsquo;s, amply stored with provisions, and kept by a daughter of Nogher
      M&rsquo;Cormick, awaited them. Nothing that could render them easy was omitted,
      and many things also were procured, in the shape of additional comforts,
      to which they had not been accustomed before.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the arrival of the much wished-for vessel was announced, and
      John O&rsquo;Brien, after having agreed to let Una know by letter where the
      Bodagh&rsquo;s car should meet them, mounted the day coach, and proceeded to
      welcome home his future brother-in-law, prepared, at the same time, to
      render both to him and his parents whatever assistance they stood in need
      of, either pecuniary or otherwise, after so long and so trying a voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meeting of two such kindred spirits may be easily conceived. There
      were few words wasted between them, but they were full of truth and
      sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My noble fellow,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Brien, clasping Connor&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;she is at home
      with a beating heart and a happy one, waiting for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John,&rdquo; replied the other fervently, &ldquo;the wealth of the universe is below
      her price. I&rsquo;m not worthy of her, except in this, that I could shed my
      heart&rsquo;s dearest blood to do her good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little you know of it yet,&rdquo; said the other smiling significantly, &ldquo;but
      you will soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It appeared that Fardorougha&rsquo;s wife had borne the hardships of both
      voyages better than her husband, who, as his son sensibly observed, had
      been too much worn down before by the struggle between his love for him
      and his attachment to his money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His cares are now nearly over,&rdquo; said Connor, with a sigh. &ldquo;Indeed, he is
      so far gone that I don&rsquo;t know how to lave him while I&rsquo;m providin&rsquo; a home
      for him to die in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is already done,&rdquo; replied O&rsquo;Brien. &ldquo;Una did not forget it. They have
      a house near ours, furnished with everything that can contribute to their
      comfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connor, on hearing this, paused, and his cheek became pale and red
      alternately with emotion&mdash;his nerves thrilled, and a charm of love
      and pleasure diffused itself over his whole being.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no use in my speaking,&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;love her more than I do I
      cannot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In consequence of Fardorougha&rsquo;s illness, they were forced to travel by
      slower and shorter stages than they intended. O&rsquo;Brien, however, never left
      them; for he knew that should the miser die on the way, they would require
      the presence and services of a friend. In due time, however, they reached
      the place appointed by John for the car to meet them; and ere many hours
      had passed, they found themselves once more in what they could call their
      home. From the miser&rsquo;s mind the power of observing external nature seemed
      to have been altogether withdrawn; he made no observation whatever upon
      the appearance or novelty of the scene to which he was conveyed, nor of
      the country through which he passed; but when put to bed he covered
      himself with the bed-clothes, and soon fell into a slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor,&rdquo; said his mother, &ldquo;your father&rsquo;s now asleep, an&rsquo; won&rsquo;t miss you;
      lose no time, thin, in goin&rsquo; to see her; and may God strinthen you both
      for sich a meetin&rsquo;!&rdquo; They accordingly went. The Bodagh was out, but Una
      and her mother were sitting in the parlor when the noise of a jaunting-car
      was heard driving up to the door; Una involuntarily looked out of the
      window, and seeing two she started up, and putting her hands together,
      hysterically exclaimed thrice, &ldquo;Mother, mother, mother, assist me, assist
      me&mdash;he&rsquo;s here!&rdquo; Her mother caught her in her arms; and at the same
      moment Connor rushed in. Una could only extend her arms to receive him; he
      clasped her to his heart, and she sobbed aloud several times rapidly, and
      then her head sank upon his bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother and brother were both weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lover looked down upon her, and, as he hung over the beautiful and
      insensible girl, the tears which he shed copiously bedewed her face. After
      a few minutes she recovered, and her brother, with his usual delicacy,
      beckoned to his mother to follow him out of the room, knowing that the
      presence of a third person is always a restraint upon the interchange of
      even the tenderest and purest affection. Both, therefore, left them to
      themselves; and we, in like manner, must allow that delicious interview to
      be sacred only to themselves, and unprofaned by the gaze or presence of a
      spectator. The Bodagh and his wife were highly gratified at the steps
      their children had taken to provide for the comfort of Fardorougha and his
      wife. The next day the whole family paid them a visit, but on seeing the
      miser, it was clear that his days were numbered. During the most vigorous
      and healthy period of his life, he had always been thin and emaciated; but
      now, when age, illness, the severity of a sis months&rsquo; voyage, and, last of
      all, the hand of death, left their wasting traces upon his person, it
      would indeed be difficult to witness an image of penury more significant
      of its spirit. We must, however, do the old man justice. Since the loss of
      his money or rather since the trial and conviction of his son, or probably
      since the operation of both events upon his heart, he had seldom, if ever,
      by a single act or expression, afforded any proof that his avarice
      survived, or was able to maintain its hold upon him, against the shock
      which awakened the full power of a father&rsquo;s love.
    </p>
    <p>
      About ten o&rsquo;clock, a. m., on the fourth day after their arrival, Connor,
      who had run over to the Bodagh&rsquo;s, was hurriedly sent for by his mother,
      who desired Nelly M&rsquo;Cormick to say that his father incessantly called for
      him, and that he must not lose a moment in coming. He returned immediately
      with her, and found the old man reclining in bed, supported by his wife,
      who sat behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is my boy comin&rsquo;?&rdquo; he said, in a thin, wiry, worn voice, but in words
      which, to any person near him, were as distinct almost as ever&mdash;&ldquo;is
      my boy Connor comin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am here, father,&rdquo; replied Connor, who had just entered the sick room;
      &ldquo;sure I am always with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are, you are,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you were ever an&rsquo; always good. Give me your
      hand, Connor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connor did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor, darlin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he proceeded, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be like me. I loved money too
      much; I set my heart on it, an&rsquo; you know how it was taken away from me.
      The priest yesterday laid it upon me, out of regard to my reignin&rsquo; sin, as
      he called it, to advise you afore I die against lovin&rsquo; the wealth o&rsquo; this
      world too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I never will, father, your own misfortune ought to be a warnin&rsquo; to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, you may say that; it&rsquo;s I indeed that was misfortunate; but it was all
      through P&mdash;&mdash;an&rsquo; that nest o&rsquo; robbers, the Isle o&rsquo; Man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think of him or it now, my dear father&mdash;don&rsquo;t be discomposin&rsquo; 
      your mind about them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connor and his mother exchanged a melancholy glance; and the latter, who,
      on witnessing his frame of mind, could not help shedding bitter tears,
      said to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fardorougha dear, Fardorougha asthore machree, won&rsquo;t you be guided by me?
      You&rsquo;re now on your death&mdash;bed, an&rsquo; think of God&rsquo;s marcy&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      that you stand most in need of. Sure, ayourneen, if you had all the money
      you ever had, you couldn&rsquo;t bring a penny of it where you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but I&rsquo;m givin&rsquo; Connor advice that&rsquo;ll sarve him. Sure I&rsquo;m not
      biddin&rsquo; him to set his heart on it, for I tould the priest I wouldn&rsquo;t; but
      is that any raison why he&rsquo;d not save it? I didn&rsquo;t tell the priest that I
      wouldn&rsquo;t bid him do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Connor, &ldquo;for the love o&rsquo; God will you put these thoughts
      out o&rsquo; your heart and mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Connor dear,&rdquo; proceeded the old man, not attending to him, &ldquo;in makin&rsquo; 
      any bargain, Connor, be sure to make as hard a one as you can; but for all
      that be honest, an&rsquo; never lind a penny o&rsquo; money widout interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s wandherin&rsquo;,&rdquo; whispered his mother. &ldquo;Oh grant it may be so,
      marciful Jasus this day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honor ahagur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, darlin&rsquo;, what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s another thing that throubles me&mdash;I never knew what it was to
      feel myself far from my own till now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My bones won&rsquo;t rest in my own counthry; I won&rsquo;t sleep wid them that
      belong to me. How will I lie in a strange grave, and in a far land? Oh,
      will no one bring me back to my own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The untutored sympathies of neither wife nor son could resist this
      beautiful and affecting trait of nature, and the undying love of one&rsquo;s own
      land, emanating, as it did, so unexpectedly, from a heart otherwise
      insensible to the ordinary tendernesses of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure you are at home, avourneen,&rdquo; said Honor; &ldquo;an&rsquo; will rest wid your
      friends and relations that have gone before you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m far away from them, but now I feel more
      comforted; I have one wid me that&rsquo;s dearer to me than them all. Connor and
      I will sleep together, won&rsquo;t we, Connor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This affectionate transition from every other earthly object to himself,
      so powerfully smote the son&rsquo;s heart that he could not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ails him, Connor?&rdquo; said his wife. &ldquo;Help me to keep up his head&mdash;Saver
      above!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connor raised his head, but saw at a glance that the last struggle in the
      old man&rsquo;s heart was over. The miser was no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little now remains to be said. The grief for old age, though natural, is
      never abiding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The miser did sleep with his own; and after a decent period allotted to
      his memory, need we say that our hero and heroine, if we may be permitted
      so to dignify them, were crowned in the enjoyment of those affections
      which were so severely tested, and at the same time so worthy of their
      sweet reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ned M&rsquo;Cormick and Biddy Nulty followed their example, and occupied the
      house formerly allotted to Fardorougha and his wife. John O&rsquo;Brien
      afterwards married, and the Bodagh, reserving a small but competent farm
      for himself, equally divided his large holdings between his son and
      son-in-law. On John&rsquo;s mojority he built a suitable house; but Una and her
      husband, and Honor, all live with themselves, and we need scarcely say,
      for it is not long since we spent a week with them, that the affection of
      the old people for their grandchildren is quite enthusiastic, and that the
      grandchildren, both boys and girls, are worthy of it.

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
