      GOING TO MAYNOOTH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Denis O&rsquo;Shaughnessy was old Denis&rsquo;s son; and old Denis, like many
      great men before him, was the son of his father and mother in particular,
      and a long line of respectable ancestors in general. He was, moreover, a
      great historian, a perplexing controversialist, deeply read in Dr.
      Gallagher and Pastorini, and equally profound in the history of Harry the
      Eighth, and Luther&rsquo;s partnership with the devil. Denis was a tall man,
      who, from his peculiar appearance, and the nature of his dress, a light
      drab-colored frieze, was nicknamed the Walking Pigeon-house; and truly, on
      seeing him at a distance, a man might naturally enough hit upon a worse
      comparison. He was quite straight, carried both his arms hanging by his
      sides, motionless and at their full length, like the pendulums of a clock
      that has ceased going. In his head, neck, and chest there was no muscular
      action visible; he walked, in fact, as if a milk-pail were upon his crown,
      or as if a single nod of his would put the planets out of order. But the
      principal cause of the similarity lay in his roundness, which resembled
      that of a pump, running to a point, or the pigeon-house aforesaid, which
      is still better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denis, though a large man, was but a small farmer, for he rented only
      eighteen acres of good land. His family, however, like himself, was large,
      consisting of thirteen children, among whom Denis junior stood
      pre-eminent. Like old Denis, he was exceedingly long-winded in argument,
      pedantic as the schoolmaster who taught him, and capable of taking a very
      comprehensive grasp of any tangible subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Denis&rsquo;s display of controversial talents was so remarkably
      precocious, that he controverted his father&rsquo;s statements upon all possible
      subjects, with a freedom from embarrassment which promised well for that
      most distinguished trait in a controversialist&mdash;hardihood of
      countenance. This delighted old Denis to the finger ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dinny, if he&rsquo;s spared,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;will be a credit to us all yet.
      The sorra one of him but&rsquo;s as manly as anything, and as longheaded as a
      four-footed baste, so he is! nothing daunts or dashes him, or puts him to
      an amplush: but he&rsquo;ll look you in the face so stout an&rsquo; cute, an&rsquo; never
      redden or stumble, whether he&rsquo;s right or wrong, that it does one&rsquo;s heart
      good to see him. Then he has such a laning to it, you see, that the
      crathur &lsquo;ud ground an argument on anything, thin draw it out to a
      norration an&rsquo; make it as clear as rock-water, besides incensing you so
      well into the rason of the thing, that Father Finnerty himself &lsquo;ud hardly
      do it betther from the althar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The highest object of an Irish peasant&rsquo;s ambition is to see his son a
      priest. Whenever a farmer happens to have a large family, he usually
      destines one of them for the church, if his circumstances are at all such
      as can enable him to afford the boy a proper education. This youth becomes
      the centre in which all the affections of the family meet. He is
      cherished, humored in all his caprices, indulged in his boyish
      predilections, and raised over the heads of his brothers, independently of
      all personal or relative merit in himself. The consequence is, that he
      gradually became self-willed, proud, and arrogant, often to an offensive
      degree; but all this is frequently mixed up with a lofty bombast, and an
      under-current of strong disguised affection, that render his early life
      remarkably ludicrous and amusing. Indeed, the pranks of pedantry, the
      pretensions to knowledge, and the humor with which it is mostly displayed,
      render these scions of divinity, in their intercourse with the people
      until the period of preparatory education is completed, the most
      interesting and comical class, perhaps, to be found in the kingdom. Of
      these learned priestlings young Denis was undoubtedly a first-rate
      specimen. His father, a man of no education, was, nevertheless, as
      profound and unfathomable upon his favorite subjects as a philosopher; but
      this profundity raised him mightily in the opinion of the people, who
      admired him the more the less they understood him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now old Denis was determined that young Denis should tread in his own
      footsteps; and, sooth to say, young Denis possessed as bright a talent for
      the dark and mysterious as the father himself. No sooner had the son
      commenced Latin with the intention of adorning the church, than the father
      put him in training for controversy. For a considerable time the laurels
      were uniformly borne away by the veteran: but what will not learning do?
      Ere long the son got as far as syntax, about which time the father began
      to lose ground, in consequence of some ugly quotations which the son threw
      into his gizzard, and which unfortunately stuck there. By and by the
      father receded more and more, as the son advanced in his Latin and Greek,
      until, at length, the encounters were only resorted to for the purpose of
      showing off the son.
    </p>
    <p>
      When young Denis had reached the age of sixteen or seventeen, he was
      looked upon by his father and his family, as well as by all their
      relations in general, as a prodigy. It was amusing to witness the delight
      with which the worthy man would call upon his son to exhibit his talents,
      a call to which the son instantly attended. This was usually done by
      commencing a mock controversy, for the gratification of some neighbor to
      whom the father was anxious to prove the great talents of his son. When
      old Denis got the young sogarth fairly in motion, he gently drew himself
      out of the dispute, but continued a running comment upon the son&rsquo;s
      erudition, pointed out his good things, and occasionally resumed the
      posture of the controversialist to reinspirit the boy if he appeared to
      flag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dinny, abouchal, will you come up till Phadrick Murray hears you arguin&rsquo; 
      Scripthur wid myself, Dinny. Now, Phadrick, listen, but keep your tongue
      sayin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo;; just lave us to ourselves. Come up, Dinny, till you have a
      hate at arguin&rsquo; wid myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fadher, I condimnate you at once&mdash;I condimnate you as being a most
      ungrammatical ould man, an&rsquo; not fit to argue wid any one that knows
      Murray&rsquo;s English Grammar, an&rsquo; more espaciously the three concords of
      Lily&rsquo;s Latin one; that is the cognation between the nominative case and
      the verb, the consanguinity between the substantive and the adjective, and
      the blood-relationship that irritates between the relative and the
      antecedent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tould you, Phadrick!! There&rsquo;s the boy that can rattle off the high
      English, and the larned Latin, jist as if he was born wid an English
      Dictionary in one cheek, a Latin Neksuggawn in the other, an Doctor
      Gallagher&rsquo;s Irish Sarmons nately on the top of his tongue between the
      two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fadher, but that unfortunately I am afflicted wid modesty, I&rsquo;d blush
      crocus for your ignorance, as Virgil asserts in his Bucolics, <i>ut
      Virgilius ait in Bucolids</i>; and as Horatius, a book that I&rsquo;m well
      acquainted wid, says in another place, <i>Huc pertinent verba</i>, says
      he, <i>commodandi, comparandi, dandi, prornittendi, soluendi imperandi
      nuntiandi, fidendi, obsequendi, minandi irascendi, et iis contraria</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good boy, Dinny; but why would you blush for my ignorance,
      avourneen? Take care of yourself now an&rsquo; spake deep, for I&rsquo;ll outargue you
      at the heel o&rsquo; the hunt, cute as you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do I blush for your ignorance, is it? Why thin, I&rsquo;m sure I have sound
      rasons for it; only think of the gross persivarance wid which you call
      that larned work, the Lexicon in Greek, a neck-suggan. Fadher, never,
      attimpt to argue or display your ignorance wid me again. But, moreover, I
      can probate you to be an ungrammatical man from your own modus of
      argument.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go an, avourneen. Phadrick!!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m listenin&rsquo;. The sorra&rsquo;s no match for his cuteness, an&rsquo; one&rsquo;s puzzled
      to think where he can get it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you don&rsquo;t know at all what I could do by larnin&rsquo;. It would be no
      throuble to me to divide myself into two halves, an&rsquo; argue the one agin
      the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would, in throth, Dinny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, father, or cut myself acrass, an&rsquo; dispute my head, maybe, agin my
      heels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throth, would you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or practise logic wid my right hand, and bate that agin wid my left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sarra lie in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or read the Greek Tistament wid my right eye, an thranslate it at the
      same time wid my left, according to the Greek an&rsquo; English sides of my
      face, wid my tongue constrein&rsquo; into Irish, unknownst to both o&rsquo; them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Denis, he must have a head like a bell to be able to get into
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throth an&rsquo; he has that, an&rsquo; &lsquo;ill make a noise in conthroversy yet, if he
      lives. Now, Dinny, let us have a hate at histhory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hate at histhory?&mdash;wid all my heart; but before we begin, I tell
      you that I&rsquo;ll confound you precipitately; for you see, if you bate me in
      the English, I&rsquo;ll scarify you wid Latin, and give you a bang or two of
      Greek into the bargain. Och! I wish you&rsquo;d hear the sackin&rsquo; I gave Tom
      Reilly the other day; rubbed him down, as the masther says, wid a Greek
      towel, an&rsquo; whenever I complimented him with the loan of a cut on the head,
      I always gave him a plaster of Latin to heal it; but the sorra worse
      healin&rsquo; flesh in the world than Tom&rsquo;s is for the Latin, so I bruised a few
      Greek roots and laid them to his caput so nate, that you&rsquo;d laugh to see
      him. Well is it histhory we are to begin wid? If it is, come on&mdash;advance.
      I&rsquo;m ready for you&mdash;in protection&mdash;wid my guards up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha, ha! Well, if he isn&rsquo;t the drollest crathur, an&rsquo; so cute! But now
      for the histhory. Can you prove to me, upon a clear foundation, the differ
      atween black an&rsquo; white, or prove that Phadrick Murray here, long life to
      him, is an ass? Now, Phadrick, listen, for you must decide betune us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Orra, have you no other larnin&rsquo; than that to argue upon? Sure if you call
      upon me to decide, I must give it agin Dinny. Why my judgment won&rsquo;t be
      worth a hap&rsquo;orth, if he makes an ass of me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What matther how you decide, man alive, if he proves you to be one; sure
      that is all we want. Never heed shakin&rsquo; your head&mdash;listen an&rsquo; it will
      be well worth your while. Why, man, you&rsquo;ll know more nor you ever knew or
      suspected before, when he proves you to be an ass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, fadher, you&rsquo;re ungrammatical in one word; instead of
      sayin&rsquo; &lsquo;prove,&rsquo; always say probate, or probe; the word is descended, that
      is, the ancisthor of it, is probo, a deep Greek word&mdash;probo, probas,
      prob-ass, that is to say, I&rsquo;m to probe Phadrick here to be an ass. Now, do
      you see how pat I brought that in? That&rsquo;s the way, Phadrick, I chastise my
      fadher with the languages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In throth it is; go an avick. Phadrick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m listenin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phadrick, do you know the differ atween black an&rsquo; white&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Atween black an&rsquo; white? Hut, gorsoon, to be sure I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, an&rsquo; what might it be, Phadrick, my larned Athiop? What might it be,
      I negotiate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, thin, the differ atween them is this, Dinny, that black is&mdash;let
      me see&mdash;why&mdash;that black is not red&mdash;nor yallow&mdash;nor
      brown&mdash;nor green&mdash;nor purple&mdash;not cut-beard&mdash;nor a
      heather color&mdash;nor a grog-ram&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor a white?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, Dinny, not a white, abouchal; don&rsquo;t think to come over me that
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I want to know what color it is, most larned sager.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All rasonable, Dinny, Why, thin, black is&mdash;let me see&mdash;hut,
      death alive!&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;why, it&rsquo;s black, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s
      all I can say about it; yes, faix, I can&mdash;black is the color of
      Father Curtis&rsquo;s coat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; what color is that, Phadrick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s black, to be sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, what color is white, Phadrick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s a snow-color: for all the world the color of snow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;White is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, is it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dear help your head, Phadrick, if that&rsquo;s all you know about snow. In
      England, man, snow is an Oxford gray, an&rsquo; in Scotland, a pepper an&rsquo; salt,
      an&rsquo; sometimes a cut-beard, when they get a hard winther. I found that much
      in the Greek, any way, Phadrick. Thry agin, you imigrant, I&rsquo;ll give you
      another chance&mdash;what color is white?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, thin, it&rsquo;s&mdash;white&mdash;an&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; else. The sorra one but
      you&rsquo;d puzzle a saint wid your long-headed screwtations from books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, Phadrick, your preamble is, that white is white, an&rsquo; black is black?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Asy avick. I said, sure enough, that white is white; but the black I deny&mdash;I
      said it was the color of Father Curtis&rsquo;s black coat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you barbarian of the world, how I scorn your profundity an&rsquo; emotions!
      You&rsquo;re a disgrace to the human sex by your superciliousness of knowledge,
      an&rsquo; your various quotations of ignorance. Ignorantia, Phadrick, is your
      date an&rsquo; superscription. Now, stretch out your ears, till I probate, or
      probe to you the differ atween black an&rsquo; white.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phadrick!!&rdquo; said the father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m listenin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Phadrick, here&rsquo;s the griddle, an&rsquo; here&rsquo;s a clane plate. Do you see
      them here beside one another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m lookin&rsquo; at them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, shut your eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that your way, Denis, of judgin&rsquo; colors?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut your eyes, I say, till I give you ocular demonstration of the differ
      atween these two respectable colors.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;re shut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; keep them so. Now, what differ do you see atween them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sorra taste, man alive; I never seen anything in my whole life so
      clearly of a color as they are both this minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see now, Phadrick, that there&rsquo;s not the smallest taste o&rsquo; 
      differ in them, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s accordin&rsquo; to Euclid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure enough, I see the divil a taste o&rsquo; differ atween the two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Phadrick, that&rsquo;s the point settled. There&rsquo;s no discrimination at
      all atween black an&rsquo; white. They&rsquo;re both of the same color&mdash;so long
      as you keep your eyes shut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if a man happens to open his eyes, Dinny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has no right to open them, Phadrick, if he wants to prove the truth of
      a thing. I should have said probe&mdash;but it does not significate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The heavens mark you to grace, Dinny. You did that in brave style.
      Phadrick, ahagur, he&rsquo;ll make the darlin&rsquo; of an arguer whin he gets the
      robes an him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deny that; he&rsquo;ll be aquil to the best o&rsquo; thim: still, Denis, I&rsquo;d
      rather, whin I want to pronounce upon colors, that he&rsquo;d let me keep my
      eyes open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but he did it out o&rsquo; the books, man alive; an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s no goin&rsquo; 
      beyant thim. Sure he could prove it out of the Divinity, if you went to
      that. An&rsquo; what is still more, he could, by shuttin&rsquo; your eyes, in the same
      way prove black to be white, an&rsquo; white black, jist as asy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely myself doesn&rsquo;t doubt it. I suppose, by shuttin&rsquo; my eyes, the same
      lad could prove anything to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Dinny, avourneen, you didn&rsquo;t prove Phadrick to be an ass yit. Will
      you do that by histhory, too, Dinny, or by the norrations of Illocution?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, I&rsquo;m surprised at your gross imperception. Why, man, if you were
      not a <i>rara avis</i> of somnolency, a man of most frolicsome
      determinations, you&rsquo;d be able to see that I&rsquo;ve proved Phadrick to be an
      ass already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throth, I deny that you did; there wasn&rsquo;t a word about my bein&rsquo; an ass,
      in the last discoorse. It was all upon the differ atween black an&rsquo; white.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how I scorn your gravity, man! <i>Ignorantia</i>, as I said, is your
      date an&rsquo; superscription; an&rsquo; when you die, you ought to go an&rsquo; engage a
      stone-cutter to carve you a headstone, an&rsquo; make him write on it, <i>Hic
      jacet Ignorantius Redivicus</i>. An&rsquo; the translation of that is, accordin&rsquo; 
      to Publius Virgilius Maro&mdash;&lsquo;here lies a quadruped who didn&rsquo;t know the
      differ atween black an&rsquo; white.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, by the livin&rsquo;, Dinny, I dunna where you get all this deep readin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure he gets it all in the Dixonary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bedad, that Dixonary must be a fine book entirely, to thim that
      undherstand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Dinny, will you tell Phadrick the Case of Conscience atween Barny
      Branagan&rsquo;s two goats an&rsquo; Parra Ghastha&rsquo;s mare?&rdquo;
     </p>

      &ldquo;Fadher, if you were a grammarian, I&rsquo;d castigate your incompatability as
      it desarves&mdash;I&rsquo;d lay the scourge o&rsquo; syntax upon you, as no man ever

      logic can you say that aither Barny Branagan&rsquo;s goats or Parra Ghastha&rsquo;s
      mare had a conscience? I tell you it wasn&rsquo;t they had the conscience, but
      the divine who decided the difficulty. Phadrick, lie down till I

    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that, Dinny? I can hear you sittin&rsquo;.&rdquo;

     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do&mdash;I do. Death alive! there&rsquo;s no use in punchin&rsquo; my sides wid
      your feet that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, get up now an&rsquo; set your ears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now listen to him, Phadrick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was one night in winter, when all nature shone in the nocturnal beauty
      of tenebrosity: the sun had set about three hours before; an&rsquo;, accordin&rsquo; 
      to the best logicians, there was a dearth of light. It&rsquo;s the general
      opinion of philosophers&mdash;that is, of the soundest o&rsquo; them&mdash;that
      when the sun is down the moon an&rsquo; stars are usually up; an&rsquo; so they were
      on the night that I&rsquo;m narratin&rsquo; about. The moon was, wid great respect to
      her character, night-walkin&rsquo; in the sky; and the stars vegetated in
      celestial genuflexion around her. Nature, Phadrick, was in great state;
      the earth was undher our feet, an&rsquo; the sky above us. The frost, too, was
      hard, Phadrick, the air keen, an&rsquo; the grass tendher. All things were
      enrobed wid verisimilitude an&rsquo; scrupulosity. In this manner was the
      terraqueous part of our system, when Parra Ghastha&rsquo;s mare, after havin&rsquo; 
      taken a cowld collation on Barny Branagan&rsquo;s grass, was returnin&rsquo; to her
      master&rsquo;s side o&rsquo; the merin; an&rsquo; Barny Branagan&rsquo;s goats, havin&rsquo; tasted the
      sweets of Parra Ghastha&rsquo;s cabbages, were on their way acrass the said
      merin to their own side. Now it so happened that they met exactly at a
      narrow gap in the ditch behind Rosha Halpin&rsquo;s house. The goats, bein&rsquo; 
      coupled together, got one on each side of the rift, wid the rope that
      coupled them extended acrass it. The mare stood in the middle of it, so
      that the goats were in the way of the mare, an&rsquo; the mare in the way of the
      goats. In the meantime they surveyed one another wid great composure, but
      had neither of them the politeness to stir, until Rosha Halpin came
      suddenly out, an&rsquo; emptied a vessel of untransparent wather into the ditch.
      The mare, who must have been an animal endowed wid great sensibility of
      soul, stooped her head suddenly at the noise; an&rsquo; the goats, who were
      equally sentimental, gave a start from nervishness. The mare, on raisin&rsquo; 
      her head, came in contact wid the cord that united the goats; an&rsquo; the
      goats, havin&rsquo; lost their commandin&rsquo; position, came in contact wid the neck
      o&rsquo; the mare. <i>Quid multis?</i> They pulled an&rsquo; she pulled, an&rsquo; she
      pulled an&rsquo; they pulled, until at length the mare was compelled to practise
      the virtue of resignation in the ditch, wid the goats about her neck. She
      died by suspinsion; but the mettlesome ould crathur, wid a love of justice
      that did her honor, hanged the goat&rsquo;s in requital; for they departed this
      vale of tears on the mountain side along wid her, so that they had the
      satisfaction of dyin&rsquo; a social death together.&mdash;Now, Phadrick, you
      quadruped, the case of conscience is, whether Parra Ghastha has a right to
      make restitution to Barny Branagan for the loss of his goats, or Barny
      Branagan to Parra Ghastha for the loss of his mare?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bedad, that&rsquo;s a puzzler!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it, Phadrick? But wait till you hear how he&rsquo;ll clear it up! Do it
      for Phadrick, Dinny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yis, Phadrick, I&rsquo;ll illusthrate your intellects by divinity. You see,
      Phadrick, you&rsquo;re to suppose me to be in the chair, as confessor. Very
      well,&mdash;or <i>valde</i>, in the larned languages&mdash;Parra Ghastha
      comes to confess to me, an&rsquo; tells me that Barny Branagan wants to be paid
      for his goats. I tell him it&rsquo;s a disputed point, an that the price o&rsquo; the
      goats must go to the church. On the other hand, Barny Branagan tells me
      that Parra Ghastha wishes to be paid for his mare. I say again, it&rsquo;s a
      disputed point, an&rsquo; that the price o&rsquo; the mare must go to the church&mdash;the
      amount of the proceeds to be applied in prayer towards the benefit of the
      parties, in the first instance, an&rsquo; of the faithful in general
      afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phadrick!!!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that I may never, but he bates the globe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denny&rsquo;s character is a very common one in the remote parts of Ireland,
      where knowledge is novelty, and where the slightest tinge of learning is
      looked upon with such reverence and admiration, as can be properly
      understood only by those who have an opportunity of witnessing it. Indeed,
      few circumstances prove the great moral influence which the Irish
      priesthood possesses over the common people more forcibly, than the
      extraordinary respect paid by the latter to such as are designed for the
      &ldquo;mission.&rdquo; The moment the determination is made, an incipient sanctity
      begins, as it were, to consecrate the young priest; and a high opinion of
      his learning and talents to be entertained, no matter how dull he may be
      so far as honest nature is concerned. Whatever he says is sure to have
      some hidden meaning in it, that would be&rsquo; highly edifying, if they
      themselves understood it. But their own humility comes in here to prop up
      his talents; and whatsoever perplexity there may be in the sense of what
      he utters, is immediately attributed to learning altogether beyond their
      depth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love of learning is a conspicuous principle in an Irish peasant; and in no
      instance is it seen to greater advantage, than when the object of it
      appears in the &ldquo;makins of a priest.&rdquo; Among all a peasant&rsquo;s good and evil
      qualities, this is not the least amiable. How his eye will dance in his
      head with pride, when the young priest thunders out a line of Virgil or
      Homer, a sentence from Cicero, or a rule from Syntax! And with what
      complacency and affection will the father and relations of such a person,
      when sitting during a winter evening about the hearth, demand from him a
      translation of what he repeats, or a grammatical analysis, in which he
      must show the dependencies and relations of word upon word&mdash;the
      concord, the verb, the mood, the gender, and the case; into every one and
      all of which the learned youth enters with an air of oracular importance,
      and a pollysyllabicism of language that fails not in confounding them with
      astonishment and edification. Neither does Paddy confine himself to Latin
      or Greek, for his curiosity in hearing a little upon all known branches of
      human learning is boundless. When a lad is designed for the priesthood, he
      is, as if by a species of intuition, supposed to know more or less of
      everything&mdash;astronomy, fluxions, Hebrew, Arabic, and the black art,
      are subjects upon which he is frequently expected to dilate; and vanity
      scruples not, under the protection of their ignorance, to lead the erudite
      youth through what they believe to be the highest regions of imagination,
      or the profoundest depths of science and philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is, indeed, in those brilliant moments, when the young priest is
      launching out in full glory upon some topic of which he knows not a
      syllable, that it would be a learned luxury to catch him. These flights,
      however, are very pardonable, when we consider the importance they give
      him in the eyes of his friends, and reflect upon that lofty and
      contemptuous pride, and those delectable sensations which the appearance
      of superior knowledge gives to the pedant, whether raw or trained, high or
      low, in this profession or the other. It matters little that such a
      feeling dilates the vanity in proportion to the absence of real knowledge
      or good sense: it is not real, but affected knowledge, we are writing
      about. Pride is confined to no condition; nor is the juvenile pedantry of
      a youth upon the hob of an Irish chimney-corner much different from the
      pride which sits upon the brow of a worthy Lord Mayor, freshly knighted,
      lolling with strained dignity beside his honorable brother, the mace,
      during a city procession; or of a Lady Mayoress, when she reads upon a
      dead wall her own name flaming in yellow capitals, at the head of a
      subscription ball; or, what is better still, the contemptuous glance
      which, while about to open the said ball, her ladyship throws at that poor
      creature&mdash;the Sheriff&rsquo;s wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, however, to the enjoyment of this assumption of profound
      learning which characterizes the young priest, a different spirit,
      considerably more practical, often induces him to hook in other motives.
      The learning of Denis O&rsquo;Shaughnessy, for instance, blazed with peculiar
      lustre whenever he felt himself out at elbows; for the logic with which he
      was able to prove the connection between his erudition and a
      woollen-draper&rsquo;s shop, was, like the ignorance of those who are to be
      saved, invincible. Whenever his father considered a display of the son&rsquo;s
      powers in controversy to be <i>capital</i>, Denis, who knew the <i>mollia
      tempora fandi</i>, applied to him for a hat. Whenever he drew a heretic,
      as a person who will be found hereafter without the wedding garment, and
      clinched the argument with half a dozen quotations from syntax or Greek
      grammar, he uniformly came down upon the father for a coat, the cloth of
      which was finer in proportion to the web of logic he wove during the
      disputation. Whenever he seated himself in the chair of rhetoric, or gave
      an edifying homily on prayer, with such eloquence as rendered the father&rsquo;s
      admiration altogether inexpressible, he applied for a pair of
      smallclothes; and if, in the excursiveness of his vigorous imagination he
      travelled anywhere beyond the bounds of common sense, he was certain to
      secure a pair of shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, of course, did not escape the satirical observation of the
      neighbors, who commented upon the circumstance with that good humor which
      renders their mother-wit so pleasant and spicy. The scenes where many of
      these displays took place, varied according to the occurrence of those
      usual incidents which diversify country life. Sometimes old Denis&rsquo;s hearth
      was selected; at others, a neighboring wakehouse, and not unfrequently the
      chapel-green, where, surrounded by a crowd of eager listeners, the young
      priest and his Latin would succeed in throwing the hedge-schoolmaster and
      his problems completely into the shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father&rsquo;s pride, on these occasions, always prompted him to become the
      aggressor; but he only did this to draw out the talents of his son to more
      advantage. Never was man foiled with less regret than old Denis; nor did
      ever man more bitterly repent those little touches of vanity, which,
      sometimes induced him, when an opportunity of prostrating Denny arrived,
      to show what he could have done, by giving the son&rsquo;s argument an
      unexpected brainblow. These accidental defeats always brought the son!
      more than he lost by them; for the father usually made him a
      peace-offering in the shape of pocket-money, books, or clothes. The great
      amusement of the peasantry around the chapel-green of a Sunday, was to
      hear the father and son engaged in argument; and so simple was the
      character of both, that their acquaintances declared, they could know by
      the state of young Denis&rsquo;s coat, and the swaggering grasp with which old
      Denis held his staff, that an encounter was about to take place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young O&rsquo;Shaughnessy&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; bare,&rdquo; they would observe; &ldquo;there&rsquo;ll be
      hard arguin&rsquo; till he gets the clothes. He&rsquo;s puttin&rsquo; in for a black coat
      now, he&rsquo;s so grave. Go on, Denny,&rdquo; they would say again: &ldquo;more power an&rsquo; a
      dacenter sleeve to your elbow. Stick to him!&mdash;very good!&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      a clincher!&mdash;you&rsquo;re gone beyond the skirts, Denny!&mdash;let him
      pocket that larnin&rsquo;. Dinis, you&rsquo;re bate, body and slaves! (* altogether;
      completely)&mdash;you&rsquo;re no match for the gorsoon, Dinis. Good agin,
      abouchal!&mdash;that&rsquo;s puttin&rsquo; the collar on it!&rdquo;&mdash;And so on, varying
      the phrase according to the whim of the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing gave the father greater pleasure than these observations, although
      the affected earnestness with which he encountered the son, and his
      pretended indignation at those who affirmed him to have been beaten, were
      highly amusing to the bystanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such discussions were considered highly edifying and instructive by them,
      and they were sometimes at a loss whether to give the palm of ingenuity
      and eloquence to the father or Denny. The reader, however, must not
      suppose that the contemptuous expressions scattered over Denny&rsquo;s
      rhetorical flourishes; when discussing these points with his father,
      implied want of reverence or affection&mdash;far from it. On the contrary,
      the father always liked him the better for them, inasmuch as they proved
      Denny&rsquo;s vast superiority over himself. They were, therefore, only the
      licenses and embellishments of discussion, tolerated and encouraged by him
      to whom they were applied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denny at length shot up to the stature of a young man, probably about
      eighteen; and during the two last years of his school studies he presented
      a considerable, if not a decidedly marked change in his character and
      external appearance. His pride became more haughty, and the consciousness
      of his learning, and of the influence annexed to the profession for which
      he was intended, put itself forth with less discussion, but more energy.
      His manners and attitude became constrained; the expression of his face
      began to darken, and to mould itself into a stiff, gloomy formality, that
      was strongly calculated to conceal the natural traits of his character.
      His dress, too, had undergone a great improvement; for instead of wearing
      shop blue or brown, he wore good black broad-cloth, had a watch in his
      fob, a respectable hat, and finer linen.
    </p>
    <p>
      This change, now necessary in consequence of his semiclerical character,
      influenced him through every relation of life. His nearest friends, whilst
      their pride in him increased, fell off to a more respectful distance; and
      his deportment, so far from being that of a good-humored Bobadil of
      polemics and pedantry upon all known and unknown subjects, became silent
      and solemn, chequered only during the moments of family conviviality by an
      excessive flow of that pleasant and still incomprehensible learning for
      the possession of which he had so honestly earned himself a character.
      Much of his pedantry was now lopped off, it is true, because the pride of
      his station prevented him from entering into discussions with the people.
      It cost him, however, some trouble to overcome his early tendencies; nor,
      after all, can it be affirmed that he altogether succeeded in eradicating
      them. Many a grave shrug, and solemn wink, and formal nod, had he to
      answer for, when his foot touched the debatable land of controversy.
      Though contrary to the keeping and dignity of his position in life, yet
      did honest Denny then get desperately significant, and his face amazingly
      argumentative. Many a pretender has he fairly annihilated by a single
      smile of contempt that contained more logic than a long argument from
      another man. In fact, the whole host of rhetorical figures seemed breaking
      out of his face. By a solitary glance of his eye he could look a man into
      a dilemma, and practise a <i>sorites</i>, or a homemade syllogism, by the
      various shiftings of his countenance, as clearly as if he had risen to the
      full flight of his former bombast. He had, in short, a <i>prima facie</i>
      disposition to controversy; his nose was set upon his face in a kind of
      firm defiance against infidels, heretics, and excommunicated persons; and
      when it curled with contempt of another, or with pride in the power that
      slumbered in itself, it seemed to give the face from which it projected,
      and the world at large, the assurance of a controversialist. Nor did his
      negative talents rest here: a twist of his mouth to the right or left ear,
      was nicely shaded away into a negative or affirmative, according as he
      intended it should be taken; and when he used his pocket-handkerchief, he
      was certain, though without uttering a syllable, to silence his opponent,
      so contemptuously did his intonations rout the arguments brought against
      him. The significance and force of all these was heightened by the mystery
      in which they were wrapped; for whenever unbending decorum constrained him
      to decline the challenges of the ignorant, with whom discussion would now
      be degradation, what could he do to soothe his vanity, except, as the poet
      says, with folded arms and a shaking of the head to exclaim&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Well,
      well we know;</i> or, <i>if we could, and if we would;</i> or, <i>if we
      list to speak</i>; or, <i>there be an if they might;</i>&rdquo; which left the
      imaginations of his hearers at liberty to conceive more fully of those
      powers which his modesty declined exhibiting. For some time before he got
      absolutely and finally into black, even his father gave up his accustomed
      argument in despair. The son had become an adept in all the intricacies
      and obscurities of Latin, and literally overwhelmed the old man with small
      inundations of that language, which though, like all inundations, rather
      muddy, yet were they quite sufficient to sweep the worthy veteran before
      them.

      Young Denis O&rsquo;Shaughnessy was now pretty nearly finished at school, that
      is to say, almost fit for Maynooth; his studies, though higher, were less
      assiduous; his leisure was consequently greater; and it is well known,
      that a person of his character is never asked to work, except it be his
      own pleasure to labor a day or two, by way of amusement. He might now be
      seen walking of a warm day along the shady sides of the hedges, with a
      book in his hand, or stretched listlessly upon the grass, at study; or
      sauntering about among the neighboring workmen, with his forefinger
      between the leaves of his book, a monument of learning and industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not to be supposed, however, that Denis, who was an Irishman of
      eighteen, handsome and well made, could be altogether insensible to female
      beauty, and seductive charms of the sex. During his easy saunterings&mdash;or,
      as the Scotch say, &ldquo;daunerings&rdquo;&mdash;along the roads and about the green
      hedges, it often happened that he met a neighbor&rsquo;s daughter; and Denis,
      who, as a young gentleman of breeding, was bound to be courteous, could
      not do less than accost her with becoming urbanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-mornin&rsquo;, Miss Norah,&rdquo; we will suppose him to say, when meeting a
      good-looking arch girl of his acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morrow, Mr. O&rsquo;Shaughnessy. I hope you&rsquo;re well, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I am, at present, in superlatively ecclesiastical health, Miss
      Norah. I hope all your family are well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All very well, I thank you, sir, barrin&rsquo; myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; pray what&rsquo;s the matther wid you, Miss Norah? I hope&rdquo; (with an
      exceeding grave but complacent smile) &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not affected wid the amorous
      passion of love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that &lsquo;ud be tellin&rsquo;, Mr. O&rsquo;Shaughnessy! But supposin&rsquo; I am, what
      ought I to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s really a profound question, Miss Norah. But though I cannot tell
      you what to do, I can tell you what I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; what is that, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Miss Norah, that he who is so beatified as to secure you in the
      matrimonial paction&mdash;<i>compactum</i> it is in the larned languages&mdash;in
      other words&mdash;to condescend to your capacity&mdash;he who is married
      to you will be a happy man. There is a juvenility about your eyes, and an
      efflorescence of amaranthine odoriferousness about your cheeks and breath
      that are enough to communicate the centrifugal motion to any brain adorned
      with the slightest modicum of sentiment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He who marries me will be a happy man!&rdquo; she exclaimed, repeating these
      expressions, probably because they were the only words she understood. &ldquo;I
      hope so, Misther O&rsquo;Shaughnessy. But, sure enough, who&rsquo;d expect to hear
      sich soft talk from the makins of a priest? Very well, sir! Upon my word
      I&rsquo;ll be tellin&rsquo; Father Finnerty that you do be spakin&rsquo; up to the girls!&mdash;Now!!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Miss Norah; you wouldn&rsquo;t do that merely for my sayin&rsquo; that you&rsquo;re
      the handsomest girl in the parish. Father Finnerty himself might say as
      much, for it would be nothing but veracity&mdash;nothing but truth, Miss
      Norah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! but he wouldn&rsquo;t be pattin&rsquo; me on the cheek! Be asy, Mr.
      O&rsquo;Shaughnessy; there&rsquo;s Darby Brady lookin&rsquo; at you, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll be tellin&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; said Denis, starting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl replied only by an arch laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my classicality, Miss Norah, you&rsquo;re a rogue; there&rsquo;s nobody lookin&rsquo;,
      you seraphim!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s a pair of us rogues, Misther Dinis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Miss Norah; I was only feeling your cheek as a philosophical
      experiment. Philosophers often do it, in order to make out an hypothesis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Misther Dinis, if I&rsquo;m not marrid till you&rsquo;re a priest, won&rsquo;t you say the
      words for me for nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So long as you ask it wid such a brilliant smiled Miss Norah, do you
      think that any educated young man who has read about beauty an&rsquo; 
      sentimentality in books, could refuse you? But you know, Miss Norah, that
      the clergyman who marries a couple has always the right of kissing the
      bride. Now I wouldn&rsquo;t claim my right then; but it might be possible by a
      present compromise to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;. What would you think, for
      instance, to give me that now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To give you what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why the&mdash;&mdash;indeed it&rsquo;s but a slight recompense, the&mdash;k&mdash;&mdash;
      the salutation&mdash;the kiss. You know what tasting the head means?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix, Misther Dinis, you&rsquo;re a great rogue. Who&rsquo;d think it indeed? Sure
      enough, they say smooth water runs deep! Why one &lsquo;ud suppose butther
      wouldn&rsquo;t melt in your mouth to look at you; an&rsquo; yet you want to be toyin&rsquo; 
      wid the girls! Indeed an&rsquo; faix, it&rsquo;s a great shame for the likes o&rsquo; you,
      that&rsquo;s bint on Maynooth, to be thinkin&rsquo; of coortin&rsquo; at all. But wait! Upon
      my word, I&rsquo;ll have a fine story agin you, plase goodness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This latter threat the mischievous girl threw out with a grave face, in
      order to bring Denis into a more ridiculous dilemma; for she saw clearly
      that he labored under a heavy struggle between timidity and gallantry. The
      ruse succeeded. Denis immediately changed his tone, and composed his face
      into a grave admonitory aspect, nearly equal to a homily on prudence and
      good conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Norah,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;perhaps I acted wrong in carrying my trial of your
      disposition too far. It&rsquo;s a thing, however, which we who are intended for
      the church are ordered to do, that we may be able to make out what are
      called in this very book you see wid me, cases of conscience. But the task
      is now over, Miss Norah; and, in requital for your extrame good nature, I
      am bound to administer to you a slight lecture on decorum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, attend your duties regularly. I will soon be goin&rsquo; to
      Maynooth; an&rsquo; as you are one of the girls for whom I have the greatest
      regard, I will expect on my return to hear a good account of you. It is
      possible that you&rsquo;ll be introduced in my absence to the honors of
      matrimony; but even so, I know that peace, an&rsquo; taciturnity, an&rsquo; submission
      will be your most signal qualifications. You will then be in a situation
      equal to that of a Roman matron. As for us, Miss Norah, we are subject to
      the dilapidations of occasional elevation. The ambrosia of sentiment lies
      in our path. We care not for the terrestrialities of life, when separated
      from the great principle of the poet&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Omnia vincit amor, et nos cedamus amori</i>.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      That&rsquo;s Hebrew, Miss Norah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say you know a power of larnin&rsquo;, Misther Dinis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know the seven languages; but what is all that compared to the
      cardinal virtues. This world is a mere bird of passage, Miss Norali; and
      it behooves us to be ever on the wing for futurity and premeditation. Now,
      will you remember the excellent moral advice I have given you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I will, sir,&rdquo; replied the roguish minx, tripping away;
      &ldquo;particularly that you promised to marry me for nothin&rsquo; if I&rsquo;d give you a
      kiss!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give up everything like levity, Miss Norah. Attend your du&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0003" id="linkimage-0003">

    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fool, Misther O&rsquo;Shaughnessy! Why didn&rsquo;t you take the kiss, an&rsquo; 
      spare the king&rsquo;s English?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On making this observation she redoubled her pace, and left Denis now
      perfectly sensible that he was a proper subject for her mirth. He turned
      about, and called after her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had I known that you were only in jocosity, Miss Nora, upon my
      classicality, I&rsquo;d have given you the k&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He now perceived that she was beyond hearing, and that it was unnecessary
      to finish the sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      These accidental meetings between Denis and the pretty daughters of the
      neighboring farmers were, somehow, very frequent. Our hero, however, was
      always extremely judicious in tempering his gallantry and moral advice to
      his young female acquaintances. In the beginning of the conversation he
      was sly and complimentary, afterwards he became more insinuating, then
      more direct in his praises of their beauty; but as his timidity on the
      point of character was known, the mischief-loving girls uniformly ended
      with a threat of exposing him to the priest, to his friends, or to the
      neighbors, as the whim directed them. This brought him back to his
      morality again; he immediately commenced an exhortation touching their
      religious duties, thus hoping to cover, by a trait more becoming his
      future destination, the little harmless badinage in which he had indulged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls themselves frequently made him the topic of conversation, a
      proof that he was not altogether indifferent to them. In these little
      conclaves he came very well off. Among them all it was admitted &ldquo;that
      there was a rogue in his coat;&rdquo; but this was by no means uttered in a tone
      of voice that betrayed any disrelish to him. On the contrary, they often
      said&mdash;and many of them with an involuntary sigh&mdash;that &ldquo;he was
      too purty to be made a priest of;&rdquo; others, that &ldquo;it was a pity to make a
      priest of so fine a young man;&rdquo; others, again, that &ldquo;if he must be a
      priest, the colleens would be all flockin&rsquo; to hear his sarmons.&rdquo; There was
      one, however, among them who never mentioned him either in praise or
      censure; but the rapid changes of her expressive countenance gave strong
      indications to an observing eye that his name, person, and future
      prospects were capable of exciting a deep and intense interest in her
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he began to appear on horseback; and as he had hitherto been in
      the habit of taking that exercise bare-backed, now he was resolved to get
      into a saddle, and ride like a gentleman. Henceforth he might be seen
      mounted upon one of his father&rsquo;s horses, quite erect, and with but one
      spur, which was, in fact, the only spur, except the whiskey bottle, that
      had been in the family for three generations. This was used, he declared,
      for no other purpose in life than that of &ldquo;stimulating the animal to the
      true clerical trot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the moment he became a mounted man he assumed an air of less
      equivocal command in the family; and not only to his own relations was
      this authority manifested, but to his more distant acquaintances, and, in
      short, to the whole parish. The people now began to touch their hats to
      him, which act of respect he returned as much in imitation of the parish
      priest as possible. They also began to ask him what o&rsquo;clock it was, and
      Denis, with a peculiar condescension, balanced still with becoming
      dignity, stopped, pulled out his watch, and told the hour, after which he
      held it for a few seconds to his ear with an experienced air, then put it
      in a dignified manner in his fob, touched the horse with the solitary
      spur, put himself more erect, and proceeded with&mdash;as he himself used
      to say, when condemning the pride of the curate&mdash;&ldquo;all the lordliness
      of the parochial priest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The notions which the peasantry entertain of a priest&rsquo;s learning are as
      extravagant as they are amusing, and such, indeed, as would be too much
      for the pedantic vanity inseparable from a half-educated man to disclaim.
      The people are sufficiently reasonable, however, to admit gradations in
      the extent of knowledge acquired by their pastors; but some of the figures
      and illustrations which they use in estimating their comparative merits
      are highly ludicrous. I remember a young man, who, at the age of
      twenty-two, set about preparing himself for the church. He lived in the
      bosom of a mountain, whose rugged breast he cultivated with a strength
      proportioned to the difficulty of subduing it. He was a powerful young
      fellow, quiet and inoffensive in his manners, and possessed of great
      natural talents. It was upon a Monday morning, in the month of June, that
      the school-room door opened a foot and a half wider than usual, and a
      huge, colossal figure stalked in, with a kind of bashful laugh upon his
      countenance, as if conscious of the disproportion betwixt his immense size
      and that of the other schoolboys. His figure, without a syllable of
      exaggeration, was precisely such as I am about to describe. His height six
      feet, his shoulders of an enormous breadth, his head red as fire; his
      body-coat made after the manner of his grandfather&rsquo;s&mdash;the skirts of
      it being near his heels&mdash;and the buttons behind little less than
      eighteen inches asunder. The pockets were cut so low, that when he
      stretched his arm to its full length, his fingers could not get further
      than the flaps; the breast of it was about nine inches longer than was
      necessary, so that when he buttoned it, he appeared all body. He wore no
      cravat, nor was his shirt-collar either pinned or buttoned, but lay open
      as if to disclose an immense neck and chest scorched by the sun into a
      rich and healthy scarlet. His chin was covered with a sole of red-dry
      bristles, that appeared to have been clipped about a fortnight before; and
      as he wore neither shoe nor stocking, he exhibited a pair of legs to which
      Rob Roy&rsquo;s were drumsticks. They gave proof of powerful strength, and the
      thick fell of bristly hair with which they were covered argued an amazing
      hardihood of constitution and tremendous physical energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, Masther, I&rsquo;m comin&rsquo; to school to you!&rdquo; were the first words he
      uttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now there ran beneath the master&rsquo;s solemnity of manner a broad but shallow
      under-current of humor, which agreed but poorly with his pompous display
      of learning. On this occasion his struggle to retain the grave and
      overcome the ludicrous was unavailing. The startling fact thus uncouthly
      announced by so grotesque a candidate for classical knowledge occasioned
      him to receive the intelligence with more mirth than was consistent with
      good breeding. His pupils, too, who were hitherto afraid to laugh aloud,
      on observing his countenance dilate into an expression of laughter which
      he could not conceal, made the roof of the house ring with their mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence, gintlemen,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;<i>legite, perlegite, et relegite</i>&mdash;study,
      gintlemen, study&mdash;pluck the tree of knowledge, I say, while the fruit
      is in season. Denny O&rsquo;Shaughnessy, what are you facetious for? <i>Quid
      rides, Dionysi</i> And so, Pether&mdash;is Pettier your pronomen&mdash;quo
      nomine gowdes? Silence, boys!&mdash;perhaps he was at Latin before, and
      we&rsquo;ll try him&mdash;<i>quo nomine gowdes, Pethre?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A stare of awkward perplexity was the only reply he could get from the
      colossus he addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you&rsquo;re fished up from the Streights (* Alluding to the Colossus of
      Rhodes) at last, Pether?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, my name&rsquo;s not Pether. My father&rsquo;s name is Paddy Doorish, but my own
      is Franky. I was born in Lisnagh; but we lived double as long as I can
      mind in the Mountain Bar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, Franky, what put Latin into your head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no Latin put into my head; I&rsquo;m comin&rsquo; to you for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, you graceful sprig of juvenility, have you the conscience to think
      that I&rsquo;d undhertake to fill what you carry on your showlders on the same
      terms that I&rsquo;d take for replenishing the head of a rasonable youth? Would
      you be so unjust in all the principles of correct erudition as to expect
      that, my worthy Man-mountain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect it,&rdquo; said Frank; &ldquo;all that&rsquo;s in your head wouldn&rsquo;t fill
      the corner of mine, if you go accordin&rsquo; to size; but I&rsquo;ll pay you for
      tachin&rsquo; me as much as you know yourself, an&rsquo; the more I larn the less
      pains you&rsquo;ll have wid me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Franky, however, made an amazing progress&mdash;so very rapid, indeed,
      that in about three years from that day he found himself in Maynooth, and
      in three years more was an active curate, to whom that very teacher
      appeared as slavishly submissive as if he had never ridiculed his
      vulgarity or ungainly dimensions. Poor Frank, however, in consequence of
      the rapid progress he made, and of the very short interval which elapsed
      from the period of his commencing Latin until that of his ordination, was
      assigned by the people the lowest grade in learning. The term used to
      designate the rank which they supposed him to hold, was both humorous and
      expressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Franky,&rdquo; they would say, &ldquo;is no finished priest in the larnin&rsquo;; he&rsquo;s but
      a <i>scowdher</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now a <i>scowdher</i> is an oaten cake laid upon a pair of tongs placed
      over the greeshaugh, or embers, that are spread out for the purpose of
      baking it. In a few minutes the side first laid down is scorched: it is
      then turned, and the other side is also scorched; so that it has the
      appearance of being baked, though it is actually quite raw within. It is a
      homely, but an exceedingly apt illustration, when applied to such men as
      Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Frank,&rdquo; they would observe, &ldquo;is but a <i>scowdher</i>&mdash;the sign
      of the tongs&mdash;No. 11, is upon him; so that it is asy known he never
      was laid to the <i>muddha arran</i>,&rdquo; *&mdash;that is to say, properly
      baked&mdash;or duly and thoroughly educated.
    </p>
    <p>
      * The <i>Muddha Arran</i> is literally &ldquo;the bread stick,&rdquo; a term in
      opposition to the <i>scowdher</i>. It is a forked stick with three legs,
      that stands opposite the fire, and supports the cake, which is placed on
      the edge until it is gradually baked. The Scowdher is, for the most part,
      made in cases of hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denis, however, to resume more directly the thread of our narrative, on
      finding himself mounted, took an inveterate prejudice against walking.
      There was something, he thought, far more dignified in riding than in
      pacing slowly upon the earth, like a common man who had not the
      justification of Latin and Greek for becoming an equestrian. Besides this
      accomplishment, there were also many other habits to be broken off, and
      more genteel ones to be adopted in their place. These were all suggested
      by his rising pride; and, in sooth, they smacked strongly of that
      adroitness with which the Irish priest, and every priest, contrives to
      accomplish the purpose of feeding well through the ostensible medium of a
      different motive.
    </p>
    <p>
      He accordingly took his father aside one morning, after he had eaten a
      more meagre breakfast that usual, and, after licking his lips, addressed
      him in these words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, father, that upon considerating the consequence to which I am
      now entitled, and the degree of respectability which, in my own person&mdash;<i>in
      propria persona</i>&mdash;I communicate to the vulgarians with whom I am
      connected&mdash;I call them vulgarians from no derogatory motive; but you
      will concede yourself, that they are ignorant of the larned languages, an&rsquo; 
      consequently, though dacent enough, still, in reference to Latin and
      Greek, but vulgarians. Well! <i>Quid multis?</i>&mdash;I say, that taking
      all these things into speculation, looking at them&mdash;<i>veluti in
      speculum</i>&mdash;it is neither dacent nor becoming that I should ate in
      the manner I have done, as vulgarly as themselves&mdash;that I should ate,
      I say, any longer, without knife and fork. Neither, I announce, shall I in
      future drink my milk any longer, as I have with all humility done
      hitherto, out of a noggin; nor continue to disrobe, my potatoes any longer
      without a becoming instrument. I must also have better viands to consume.
      You are not to be ininformed that I am in that situation of life, in
      which, from my education and other accomplishments, I must be estimated as
      duly qualified to ate beef and mutton instead of bacon, an&rsquo; to have my <i>tay</i>
      breakfast instead of stirabout, which, in polite society, is designated
      porridge. You know yourself, and must acknowledge, that I&rsquo;m soon likely to
      confer distinction and preeminence upon the poor illiterate, but honest
      creatures, with whom I am associated in the bonds of blood-relationship.
      If I were a dunce, or a booby, or a leather head, the case might be
      different; but you yourself are well acquainted with my talents of logic
      and conthroversy; an&rsquo; I have sound rasons and good authority, which I
      could quote, if necessary, for proving that nothing increases the weight
      of the brain, and accelerates to gravity and solidity more than good
      feeding. Pay attention, therefore, to my words, for I expect that they
      will be duly observed:&mdash;buy me a knife and fork; and when I get them,
      it&rsquo;s not to lay them past to rust, you consave. The beef and mutton must
      follow; and in future I&rsquo;m resolved to have my <i>tay</i> breakfast. There
      are geese, and turkeys, and pullets enough about the yard, and I am bent
      on accomplishing myself in the art of carving them. I&rsquo;m not the man now to
      be placed among the other riff-raff&rsquo; of the family over a basket of
      potatoes, wid a black clerical coat upon me, and a noggin of milk under my
      arm! I tell you the system must be changed: the schoolmaster is abroad,
      and I&rsquo;ll tolerate such vulgarity no longer. Now saddle the horse till I
      ride across the bog to Pether Rafferty&rsquo;s Station, where I&rsquo;m to sarve mass;
      plase heaven, I&rsquo;ll soon be able to say one myself, and give you all a lift
      in spirituals&mdash;ehem!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throth, Dinny, I b&rsquo;lieve you&rsquo;re right, avick; and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vick me no longer, father&mdash;that&rsquo;s another thing I forgot. It&rsquo;s full
      time that I should be sirred; and if my own relations won&rsquo;t call me Sir
      instead of Dinny, it&rsquo;s hardly to be expected that strangers will do it. I
      wish to goodness you had never stigmatized me wid so vulgar an epithet as
      Dinny. The proper word is Dionysius; and, in future, I&rsquo;ll expect to be
      called Misther Dionysius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, I or your mother needn&rsquo;t be sirrin&rsquo; you, Dinny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t made up my mind as to whether I&rsquo;ll demand that proof of my
      respectability from you and my mother, or not; but on this I&rsquo;m immovable,
      that instead of Dinny, you must, as I said, designate me Dionysius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, avourneen, I suppose only it&rsquo;s right you wouldn&rsquo;t be axin&rsquo; 
      us; but I&rsquo;m sure your poor mother will never be able to get her tongue
      about Dionnisis, it&rsquo;s so long and larned a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a larned word, no doubt; but she must persevere until she&rsquo;s able to
      masther it. I wouldn&rsquo;t for three tenpennies that the priest would hear one
      of you call me Dinny; it would degradate me very much in his estimation.
      At all events, if my mother cannot manage the orthography of Dionysius,
      let it be Denis, or anything but that signature of vulgarity, Dinny. Now,
      father, you won&rsquo;t neglect to revale what I&rsquo;ve ordered to the family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, I will not, avick&mdash;I mane&mdash;Dionnisis, avourneen&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      tell them everything as you ordhered; but as to Dionnisis, I&rsquo;m cock sure
      that poor Mave will never be able to get her ould tongue about so
      newfangled a piece of larnin&rsquo; as that is. Well, well, this knowledge bates
      the world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the horse was saddled, and Dionysius on his way with all due pomp to
      the Station, old Denis broke the matter to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mave, achora,&rdquo; said,he, &ldquo;I have sthrange news to tell you: sure Dionnisis
      is goin&rsquo; to make himself a gintleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dionnisis, our son Dionnisis, is goin&rsquo; to make himself a gintleman; he&rsquo;ll
      ate no longer widout a knife and fork.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saints about us!&rdquo; exclaimed Mave, rising and looking with alarm into her
      husband&rsquo;s face&mdash;&ldquo;saints about us, Denis, what is it ails you? Sure
      there would be nothin&rsquo; wrong wid you about the head, Denis? or maybe it&rsquo;s
      a touch of a faver you&rsquo;ve got, out riddling that corn bare-headed,
      yistherday? I remimber the time my Aunt Bridget tuck the scarlet faver,
      she begun to rave and spake foolish in the same way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, woman, if your Aunt Bridget had a faver made up of all the colors in
      the rainbow, I tell you I&rsquo;m spakin&rsquo; sinse! Our son Dionnisis proved
      himself a gintleman out in the garden wid me about an hour ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so, Denis,&rdquo; she replied, humoring&rsquo; him, for she was still
      doubly convinced that he labored under some incipient malady, if not under
      actual insanity; &ldquo;an&rsquo; what son is this, Dinny? I&rsquo;ve never heard of him
      before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our son Denis, woman alive! You must know he&rsquo;s not to be called Dinny or
      Dinis any more, but Dionnisis; he&rsquo;s to begin atin&rsquo; wid a knife an&rsquo; fork
      to-morrow; we must get him beef and mutton, and a <i>tay</i> breakfast. He
      say&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not fair play in any one that&rsquo;s so deep read in the larnin&rsquo; as
      he is, to ate like a vulgarian, or to peel his phaties wid his fingers,
      an&rsquo; him knows so much Latin an&rsquo; Greek; an&rsquo; my sowl to happiness but he&rsquo;ll
      stick to the gintlemanly way of livin&rsquo;, so far as the beef, an&rsquo; mutton,
      and tay is consamed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will! An&rsquo;, Dinis O&rsquo;Shaughnessy, who has a betther right to turn
      gintleman, nor the gorsoon that studied for that! Isn&rsquo;t it proud you ought
      to be that he has the spirit to think of sich things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll engage, Mave, on that point you&rsquo;ll find him spirited enough; for my
      part, I don&rsquo;t begrudge him what he wants; but I heard the people say, that
      no man&rsquo;s a gintleman who&rsquo;s not College-bred; and you know he&rsquo;s not that
      yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget that he has gentle blood in his veins, Denis. There was a day
      when my family, the Magennises, held their heads up; and Kolumkill says
      that the same time is to come back agin to all the ould families. Who
      knows if it&rsquo;s altogether from himself he&rsquo;s takin&rsquo; to the beef an&rsquo; mutton,
      but from prophecy; he knows what he&rsquo;s about, I&rsquo;ll warrant him. For our
      part, it&rsquo;s not right for us to cross him in it; it&rsquo;s for the good of the
      church, no doubt, an&rsquo; we might lose more by a blast upon the corn or the
      cattle, than he&rsquo;d ate the other way. That&rsquo;s my dhrame out that I had last
      night about him. I thought we were all gother somewhere that I can&rsquo;t
      rightly remimber; but anyhow there was a great sight of people in it, an&rsquo; 
      high doin&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; an in the atin&rsquo; way. I looked about me, an&rsquo; seen ever so
      many priests dressed all like the Protestant clargy; our Dinis was at the
      head of them, wid a three-cocked hat, an&rsquo; a wig upon him; he was cuttin&rsquo; 
      up beef an&rsquo; mutton at the rate of a weddin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; dhrinkin&rsquo; wine in
      metherfuls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Musha, Dinis,&rsquo; says myself, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s all this for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s all for the good of the church an&rsquo; the faithful.
      I&rsquo;m now Archbishop of the county,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;the Protestants are all
      banished, an&rsquo; we are in their place.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sorra one o&rsquo; myself all this time but thought he was a priest still;
      so says I, &lsquo;Dinny, you&rsquo;re a wantin&rsquo; to anoint Paddy Diarmud, who&rsquo;s given
      over, an&rsquo; if you don&rsquo;t I make haste, you won&rsquo;t overtake him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He must wait then till mornin&rsquo;,&rsquo; says Dinny; &lsquo;or if he chooses to die
      against my will, an&rsquo; the will o&rsquo; the church, let him take the
      quensequences. Were wealthy now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was so much frightened at the kind of voice that he spoke to me in,
      that I awoke; an&rsquo; sure enough, the first thing I heard was the fizzin&rsquo; o&rsquo; 
      bacon on the pan. I wondered! who could be up so early, an&rsquo; puttin&rsquo; my
      head through the door, there was Dinny busy at it, wid an ould knife in
      one hand, an&rsquo; an iron skiver in the other imitatin&rsquo; a fork.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What are you doin&rsquo; so early, Dinny?&rsquo; says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m practisin&rsquo;,&rsquo; says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What for?&rsquo; says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m practisin&rsquo;,&rsquo; says he, back again, &lsquo;go to bed; I&rsquo;m practisin&rsquo; for
      the church, an&rsquo; the Station that&rsquo;s to be in Pether Rafferty&rsquo;s to-day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Dinny, between you an&rsquo; me, that dhrame didn&rsquo;t come for nothin&rsquo;. So
      give the gorsoon his way, an&rsquo; if he chooses to be a gintleman, why let
      him; he&rsquo;ll be the more honor to thim that reared him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thrue for you, indeed,&mdash;Mave; he always had a high spirit ever since
      he was intinded for the robes, and would have his own way and will in
      whatever he took into his head, right or wrong, as cleverly as if he had
      the authority for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; so he ought, seein&rsquo; he wasn&rsquo;t to be slavin&rsquo; at the spade, like the
      rest o&rsquo; the family. The ways o&rsquo; them that have great larnin&rsquo; as he has,
      isn&rsquo;t like other people&rsquo;s ways&mdash;they must be humored, and have their
      own will, otherwise what &lsquo;ud they be betther than their neighbors?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other arrangements laid down by Denis, touching his determination not
      to be addressed so familiarly by his brothers and sisters, were next
      discussed in this conversation, and, of course, the same prejudice in his
      favor was manifested by his indulgent parents. The whole code of his
      injunctions was subsequently disclosed to the family in all its extent and
      rigor. Some of them heard it with surprise, and other with that kind of
      dogged indignation evinced by those who are in some degree prepared for
      the nature of the communication about to be laid before them. Altogether,
      the circumstances in which it placed them were peculiar and embarrassing.
      The Irish peasant can seldom bear to have the tenderness of domestic
      affection tampered with, whether from pride, caprice, or any other motive
      not related to his prejudices. In this instance the strongest feelings of
      the O&rsquo;Shaughnessys were brunted, as it were, in hostile array against each
      other; and although the moral force on each side was nearly equal, still
      the painful revulsion produced by Denis&rsquo;s pride, as undervaluing their
      affection, and substituting the cold forms of artificial life for the
      warmth of honest hearts like theirs, was, in the first burst of natural
      fervor, strongly, and somewhat indignantly expressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denis had been their pride, the privileged person among them&mdash;the
      individual whose talents were to throw lustre upon a nameless and unknown
      family; the future priest&mdash;the embryo preacher of eminence&mdash;the
      resistless controversialist&mdash;the holy father confessor&mdash;and,
      perhaps, for with that vivacity of imagination peculiar to the Irish, they
      could scarcely limit his exaltation&mdash;perhaps the bishop of a whole
      diocese. Had not the Lord Primate himself been the son of as humble a man?
      &ldquo;And who knows,&rdquo; said his youngest and fairest sister, who of all the
      family was most devoted to him, &ldquo;but Dinny might yet be a primate?&rdquo; And as
      she spoke, the tear of affection, pride, and enthusiasm glistened in her
      eye. Denis, therefore, had been much, even in his youth, to their simple
      hearts, and far more to their hopes and expectations, than he was in all
      the pride of his petty polemics; but when he, before whose merits, both
      real and imaginary, every heart among them bowed as before the shrine of a
      tutelar saint, turned round, ere the destined eminence he aimed at was
      half attained, and laid upon their fervent affection the icy chain of
      pride and worldly etiquette&mdash;the act was felt keenly and unexpectedly
      as the acute spasm of some sudden malady. The father and mother, however,
      both, defended him with great warmth; and by placing his motives in that
      point of view which agreed best with their children&rsquo;s prejudices, they
      eventually succeeded in reconciling his brothers and sisters in some
      degree to the necessity of adopting the phraseology he proposed&mdash;that
      they might treat him with suitable respect in the eye of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s proud of him we ought to be,&rdquo; said his father, &ldquo;and delighted that
      he has sich a risin&rsquo; spirit; an&rsquo; sure the more respect is paid to him the
      greater credit he will be to ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sure he has no right,&rdquo; said his eldest brother, &ldquo;to be settin&rsquo; up
      for a gentleman till he&rsquo;s priested. I&rsquo;m willin&rsquo; enough to sir him, only
      that it cuts me more than I&rsquo;ll say, to think that I must be callin&rsquo; the
      boy that I&rsquo;d spill the dhrop of my blood for, afther I the manner of a
      sthranger; and besides,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not clear but the neighbors will
      be passin&rsquo; remarks upon us, as they did when you and he used to be
      arguin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see them that &lsquo;ud turn it into a joke,&rdquo; said his father; &ldquo;I
      would let them know that Dinis O&rsquo;Shaughnessy&rsquo;s dog is neither to be made
      or meddled wid in a disrespectful manner, let alone his son. We are not
      widout friends and connections that &lsquo;ud take our quarrel upon them in his
      defince, if there was a needcessity for it; but there will not, for didn&rsquo;t
      my heart lep the other day to my throat wid delight, when I saw Larry Neil
      put his hand to his hat to him, comin&rsquo; up the Esker upon the mare; and may
      I never do an ill turn, if he didn&rsquo;t answer the bow to Larry, as if he was
      the priest of the parish already. It&rsquo;s the wondher of the world how he
      picks up a jinteel thing any how, an&rsquo; ever did, since he was the hoith o&rsquo; 
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the mother, &ldquo;what a norration yez rise about thratin&rsquo; the boy
      as every one like him ought to be thrated. Wait till ye see him a parish
      priest, and then yell be comin&rsquo; round him to get your daughters to keep
      house for him, and your sons edicated and made priests of; but now that
      the child takes a ginteel relish for beef and mutton, and wants to be
      respected, ye are mane an&rsquo; low spirited enough to grumble about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No mother,&rdquo; said his youngest sister, bursting into tears, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d beg it
      for him, sooner nor he should want; but I can&rsquo;t bear to be callin&rsquo; my
      brother Dinny&mdash;sir&mdash;like a stranger. It looks as if I didn&rsquo;t
      love him, or as if he was forgettin&rsquo; us, or carin&rsquo; less about us nor he
      used to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, in fact, was the root and ground of the opposition which Denis&rsquo;s
      plan received at the hands of his relations; it repressed the cordial and
      affectionate intercourse which had hitherto subsisted between them; but
      the pride of life, and, what is more, the pride of an office which ought
      always to be associated with humility, had got into his heart; the vanity
      of learning, too, thin and shallow though it was, inflated him; and the
      effect of both was a gradual induration of feeling&mdash;an habitual sense
      of his own importance, and a notion of supreme contempt for all who were
      more ignorant than himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the first impression of pain and mortification had passed away from
      the minds of his brothers and sisters, it was, however, unanimously
      admitted that he was right; and ere long, no other feeling than one of
      good-humor, mingled with drollery, could be perceived among them. They
      were clearly convinced, that he claimed no more from strangers than was
      due to him; but they certainly were not prepared to hear that he had
      brought the exactions of personal respect so completely and unexpectedly
      home to themselves as he had done. The thing, too, along with being
      unreasonable, was awkward and embarrassing in the extreme; for there is a
      kind of feeling among brothers and sisters, which, though it cannot be
      described, is very trying to their delicacy and shamefacedness under
      circumstances of a similar nature. In humble life you will see a married
      woman who cannot call her husband after his Christian name; or a husband,
      who, from some extraordinary restraint, cannot address his wife, except in
      that distant manner which the principle I allude to dictates, and habit
      confirms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denis, however, had overcome this modesty, and felt not a whit too
      shamefaced to arrogate to his own learning and character the most
      unhesitating manifestation of their deference and respect, and they soon
      scrupled not to pay it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night of that evening was pretty far advanced, when a neighbor&rsquo;s son,
      named Condy Callaghan, came to inform the family, that Denis, when
      crossing the bog on his way home, had rode into a swamp, from which he
      found much difficulty in extricating himself, but added, &ldquo;the mare is sunk
      to the saddle-skirts, and cannot get out widout men and ropes,&rdquo; In a short
      time a sufficient number of the neighbors were summoned together, and
      proceeded to the animal&rsquo;s relief. Denny&rsquo;s importance, as well as his black
      dress, was miserably tarnished; he stood, however, with as dignified an
      air as possible, and, in a bombastic style, proceeded to direct the men as
      to the best manner of relieving her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Asy, Dinny,&rdquo; said his brother, with a good-humored but significant smile&mdash;&ldquo;larning
      may be very good in its place; in the mane time, lave the business in our
      hands rather than in your own head&mdash;or if you have e&rsquo;er a scrap of
      Greek or Latin that &lsquo;ud charm ould Sobersides out, where was the use of
      sendin&rsquo; for help?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; replied Dennis, highly offended, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not tolerate vulgarity any
      longer; you must larn to address me in a more polite style. If the animal&mdash;that
      purblind quadruped&mdash;walked into the mire, by what logic can you
      produce an association between her blindness and my knowledge of Latin and
      Greek? But why do I degradate my own consequence by declaiming to you an
      eulogium upon logic? It&rsquo;s only throwing pearls before swine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mane to offind you,&rdquo; replied the warm-hearted brother; &ldquo;I meant
      you no offince in what I said, so don&rsquo;t take it ill&mdash;we&rsquo;ll have
      Sobersides out in no time&mdash;and barrin&rsquo; an extra rubbin&rsquo; down to both
      of you, neither will be the worse, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to what you hope or despair, Brian, it could produce no other
      impression on the subtility of my fancy than pity for the man who could
      compare me&mdash;considering the brilliancy of my career, and the extent
      of my future speculations&mdash;to a quadruped like Sobersides, by
      asserting that I, as well as she, ought to be rubbed down! And were it not
      that I confront the offince with your own ignorance, I would expose you
      before the townland in which we stand; ay, to the whole parish&mdash;but I
      spare you, out of respect to my own consequence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ax your pardon,&rdquo; said the brother, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t offind you in the same way
      again. What I said, I said to you as I thought a brother might&mdash;I ax
      your pardon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a slight agitation approaching to a tremor in his brother&rsquo;s
      voice, that betokened sorrow for his own impropriety in too familiarly
      addressing Denis, and perhaps regret that so slight and inoffensive a jest
      should have been so harshly received in the presence of strangers, by a
      brother who in reality had been his idol. He reflected upon the
      conversation held on that morning in the family, touching Denny&rsquo;s
      prerogative in claiming a new and more deferential deportment from them
      all; and he could not help feeling that there was in it a violation of
      some natural principle long sacred to his heart. But the all-prevading and
      indefinite awe felt for that sacerdotal character into which his brother
      was about to enter, subdued all, and reconciled him to those inroads upon
      violated Nature, despite her own voice, loudly expressed as it was in his
      bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the family was once more assembled that night, Denis addressed them
      in a tone, which implied that the <i>odium theologicum</i> had not
      prevented the contrition expressed by his brother from altogether effacing
      from his mind the traces of his offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unworthy of respect,&rdquo; he proceeded, &ldquo;as it appears by some of my
      relations I am held,&rdquo; and he glanced at his brother, &ldquo;yet I beg permission
      to state, that our worthy parochial priest, or I should rather say, the
      Catholic Rector of this parish, is of a somewhat different habit of
      thought or contemplation. I dined with him to-day&mdash;ehem&mdash;dined
      with him upon an excellent joint of mutton&mdash;I say, father&mdash;the
      mutton was good&mdash;and with his proud, pertinacious curate, whom I do
      not at all relish; whether, as Homer says&mdash;I enumerate his scurrilous
      satire, or his derogatory insinuations. His parochial pastor and spiritual
      superior is a gentleman, or, as Horace says, <i>homo factus ad unguem</i>&mdash;which
      is paraphrastically&mdash;every inch a gentleman&mdash;or more literally,
      a gentleman to the tops of his fingers&mdash;ehem&mdash;hem&mdash;down to
      the very nails&mdash;as it were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;having discussed that&mdash;<i>observatis observandis, quoad
      sacerdolem</i>&mdash;having passed my eulogium upon Father Finnerty&mdash;upon
      my word and credit though, punch is <i>prima facie</i> drink&mdash;and
      father, that brings me to remember an omission which I committed in my
      dialogue with you this morning. I forgot to say, that after my dinner, in
      the manner I expounded to you, it will be necessary to have a tumbler of
      punch&mdash;for, as Father Finnerty says, there is nothing which so
      effectually promotes the organs of digestion. Now, my introduction of
      this, in the middle of my narrative, is what the hypercritics call a
      Parenthesis, which certainly betrays no superficial portion of literary
      perusal on my part, if you could at all but understand it as well as
      Father Finnerty, our Worthy parochial incumbent, does. As for the curate,
      should I ever come to authority in the Irish hierarchy, I shall be
      strongly disposed to discountenance him; if it were only for his general
      superciliousness of conduct. So there&rsquo;s another clause disposed of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;to proceed&mdash;I say I have intelligence regarding myself,
      that will be by no means unsavory to you all. Father Finnerty and I had,
      about an hour before dinner this day, a long and tedious conversation, the
      substance of which was my future celebrity in the church. He has a claim
      on the Bishop, which he stated to me will be exercised in my favor,
      although there are several candidates for it in this parish, not one of
      whom, however, is within forty-five degree&rsquo;s of being so well qualified
      for college as myself. Father, is there not a jar&mdash;an <i>amphora</i>&mdash;as
      that celebrated satirist Juvenile has it&mdash;an <i>amphora</i>&mdash;in
      the chimly-brace, filled with liquor&mdash;get it, and let us <i>inter
      animosity</i>&mdash;I&rsquo;ll not be long a member of the domestic circle with
      you&mdash;so, upon the basis of the communication I have to make, let us,
      as I said, be&mdash;become sextons to animosity and care. &lsquo;Dionysius,&rsquo; 
      said Father Finnerty, addressing me, which shows, at all events, that I am
      not so unimportant as some of my friends would suppose&mdash;&lsquo;Dionysius,&rsquo; 
      said he &lsquo;<i>inter nos</i>&mdash;between you and me, I believe I have it in
      my power to send up a candidate to Maynooth. &lsquo;Tis true, I never make a
      promise&mdash;<i>nunquam facio votum</i>, except in certain cases, or, in
      other words, Dionysius, <i>exceptis excipiendis</i>&mdash;in which is the
      essence, as it were, of a proper vow.&rsquo; In the meantime he proceeded&mdash;&lsquo;With
      regard to your prospects in the church, I can only say, in the first
      place, and I say it with much truth and sincerity&mdash;that I&rsquo;m badly off
      for a horse; that, however, is, as I said, <i>inter nos&mdash;sub sigillo</i>.
      The old garran I have is fairly worn out&mdash;and, not that I say it,
      your father has as pretty a colt as there is within the bounds&mdash;<i>intra
      terminos parochii mei</i>, within the two ends of my parish: <i>verbum sat</i>&mdash;which
      is, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re a sensible and discreet young man. Your father,
      Dionysius, is a parishioner whom I regard and esteem to the highest degree
      of comparison, and you will be pleased to report my eulogium to himself
      and to his dacent family&mdash;and proud may they be of having so
      brilliant a youth among them as you are&mdash;ehem!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, you may all think that this was plain conversation; but I had read
      too much for that. In fact, it was logic&mdash;complate, convincing logic,
      every word of it. So I responded to him in what is called in the books,
      the <i>argumentum ad crumenam</i>; although I question but it ought to be
      designated here the <i>argumentum ad bestiam</i>. Said I, &lsquo;Father
      Finnerty, the colt, my paternal property, which you are pleased to
      eulogize so highly, is a good one; it was designed for myself when I
      should come out on the mission; however, I will undertake to say, if you
      get me into Maynooth, that my father, on my authority, will lend you the
      colt tomorrow, and the day of his claiming it will be dependent upon the
      fulfilment of your promise or <i>votum</i>.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Signatum et sigttlatum est</i>,&rsquo; said he&mdash;for, indeed, the best
      part of the discussion was conducted in Latin; &lsquo;and now,&rsquo; he continued,
      &lsquo;my excellent Dionysius, nothing remains but that the colt be presented&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;Lent,&rsquo; I responded, correcting him, &lsquo;you see, even although he
      was the priest&mdash;&lsquo;lent,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;and your Reverence will be good
      enough to give the <i>votum</i> before one or two of my friends.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looked at me sharply, not expecting to find such deep logic in one he
      conjectured to be but a tyro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You will be a useful man in the church,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;and you deserve to
      be pushed on at all events. In the meantime, tell your father that I&rsquo;ll
      ride up and breakfast with him to-morrow, and he can have a friend or two
      to talk over the <i>compactum</i>.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, father, there&rsquo;s the state of the question at present; the
      accomplishment of the condition is dependent upon yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My readers may perceive that Denis, although a pedant, was not a fool. It
      has been said that no man is a hero to his <i>valet-de-chambre</i>; but I
      think the truth of the sentiment contained in that saying is questionable.
      Denis, on the contrary, was nowhere so great a man as in his own
      chimney-corner, surrounded by his family. It was there he was learned,
      accomplished, profound; next to that, he was great among those who,
      although not prejudiced in his favor by the bonds of affection, were too
      ignorant to discover those literary pranks which he played off, because he
      knew he could do so without detection. The basis, however, of his
      character was shrewd humor and good sense; and even at the stage of life
      which we have just described, it might have been evident to a close
      observer that, when a proper knowledge of his own powers, joined to a
      further acquaintance with the world, should enable him to cast off the
      boyish assumption of pedantry, a man of a keen, ready intellect and
      considerable penetration would remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of my readers may be inclined to exclaim that the character of Denny
      is not to be found in real life; but they are mistaken who think so. They
      are not to suppose that Denis O&rsquo;Shaughnessy was the same person in his
      intercourse with intelligent men and scholars, that he appeared among the
      illiterate peasantry, or his own relations. Far from it. With the former,
      persons like him are awkward and bashful, or modest and unassuming,
      according to the bent of their natural disposition. With scholars Denis
      made few pretensions to superior knowledge; but, on the contrary, took
      refuge, if he dreaded a scrutiny into his acquirements, in the humblest
      acknowledgment of his limited reading, and total unacquaintance with those
      very topics on which he was, under other circumstances, in the habit of
      expatiating so fluently. In fact, were I to detail some of the scenes of
      his exhibitions as they were actually displayed, then I have no doubt I
      might be charged with coloring too highly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Denis had finished the oration from the chimney-corner, delivered
      with suitable gesticulations while he stood drying himself at the fire
      after the catastrophe of the swamp, a silence of some minutes followed.
      The promise of the colt made to the priest with such an air of authority,
      was a finale which the father did not expect, and by which he was not a
      little staggered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could like it all very well,&rdquo; replied the father, &ldquo;save an&rsquo; except
      givin&rsquo; away the coult that&rsquo;s worth five-an&rsquo;-twenty guineas, if he&rsquo;s worth
      a <i>&rsquo;crona-bawn</i>. To tell the blessed thruth, Dinis, if you had
      settled the business widout <i>that</i>, I&rsquo;d be betther plased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just exercise your contemplation upon it for a short period,&rdquo; replied
      Denis, &ldquo;and you will perceive that I stipulated to lend him before
      witnesses; and if Father Finnerty does not matriculate me into Maynooth,
      then do you walk down some brilliant morning or other, and take your baste
      by the head, direct yourself home, hold the bridle as you proceed, and by
      the time you&rsquo;re at the rack, you&rsquo;ll find the horse at the manger. I have
      now stated the legality of the matter, and you may act as your own
      subtility of perception shall dictate. I have laid down the law, do you
      consider the equity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the father, &ldquo;if I thought he would get you into&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Correct, quite correct: the cardinal point there is the if. If he does,
      give him the horse; but if not, reclaim the quadruped without hesitation.
      I am not to be kept back, if profundity and erudition can substantiate a
      prospect. Still, father, the easiest way is the safest, and the shortest
      the most expeditious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The embarrassing situation in which the other members of the family were
      placed, imposed upon them a profound silence, in reference to the subject
      of conversation. Yet, while Denny delivered the aforesaid harangue from
      the chimney-corner, every eye was fixed upon him with an expression of
      pride and admiration which escaped not his own notice. Their deportment
      towards him was affectionate and respectful; but none of them could so far
      or so easily violate old habits as to address him according to his own
      wishes; they therefore avoided addressing him at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Father Finnerty paid them his purposed visit, and, as he
      had promised, arrived in time for breakfast. A few of Denis&rsquo;s relations
      were assembled, and in their presence the arrangements respecting the colt
      and Denny&rsquo;s clerical prospects were privately concluded. So far everything
      was tight; the time of Denny&rsquo;s departure for Maynooth was to be determined
      by the answer which Father Finnerty should receive from the bishop; for an
      examination must, of course, take place, which was to be conducted by the
      prelate, or by some other clergyman appointed for that purpose. This and
      the necessary preparation usual on such occasions, were the only
      impediments in the way of his departure for Maynooth, a place associated
      with so many dreams of that lowly ambition which the humble circumstances
      of the peasantry permit them to entertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Irish people, I need scarcely observe, are a poor people; they are,
      also, very probably, for the same reason, an imaginative people; at all
      events, they are excited by occurrences which would not produce the same
      vivacity of emotion which they experience upon any other people in the
      world. This, after all, is but natural; a long endurance of hunger will
      render the coarsest food delicious; and, on the contrary, when the
      appetite is glutted with the richest viands, it requires a dish whose
      flavor is proportionably high and spicy to touch the jaded palate. It is
      so with our moral enjoyments. In Ireland, a very simple accession to their
      hopes or comforts produces an extraordinary elevation of mind, and so
      completely unlocks the sluices of their feelings, that every consideration
      is lost in the elation of the moment. At least it was so in Denis
      O&rsquo;Shaughnessy&rsquo;s family upon this occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had Father Finnerty received the colt, and pledged himself that
      Denny should have the place at Maynooth that was then vacant, than a
      tumultuous expression of delight burst from his family and relations,
      business was then thrown aside for the day; the house was scoured and set
      in order, as if it were for a festival; their best apparel was put on;
      every eye was bright, every heart throbbed with a delightful impulse,
      whilst kindness and hilarity beamed from their faces. In a short time they
      all separated themselves among their neighbors to communicate the
      agreeable tidings; and the latter, with an honest participation in their
      happiness, instantly laid aside their avocations, and flocked to Denis
      O&rsquo;Shaughnessy&rsquo;s, that they might congratulate him and his friends upon
      what was considered the completion of their hopes. When the day was more
      advanced, several of Denny&rsquo;s brothers and sisters returned, and the house
      was nearly filled with their acquaintances and relations. Ere one o&rsquo;clock
      had passed they wore all assembled, except old Denis, of whom, no person
      could give any intelligence. Talk, loud laughter, pure poteen, and
      good-humor, all circulated freely? the friendly neighbor unshaved, and
      with his Sunday coat thrown hastily over his work-day apparel, drank to
      Denny&rsquo;s health, and wished that he might &ldquo;bate all Maynewth out of the
      face; an&rsquo; sure there&rsquo;s no doubt of that, any how&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t myself
      remimber him puttin&rsquo; the explanations to Pasthorini before he was the bulk
      o&rsquo; my fist?&rdquo; His brothers and sisters now adopted with enthusiasm the
      terms of respect which he had prescribed for them through his father; he
      was Sirred and Misthered, and all but Reverenced, with a glow of
      affectionate triumph which they strove not to conceal. He was also
      overwhelmed with compliments of all hues and complexions: one reminded him
      of the victory he obtained over a hedge-schoolmaster who came one Sunday a
      distance of fifteen miles to sack him in English Grammar on the
      chapel-green; but as the man was no classical scholar, &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; observed
      his neighbor, &ldquo;I remember well that he couldn&rsquo;t get a word out of Misther
      Denis&rsquo;s head there but Latin; so that the poor crathur, afther travellin&rsquo; 
      fifteen long miles, had to go home agin, the show o&rsquo; the world, widout
      undherstandin&rsquo; a sintence of the larnin&rsquo; that was put an him; an&rsquo; so
      here&rsquo;s wishin&rsquo; you health, Misther Dinis, agra, an&rsquo; no fear in life but
      you&rsquo;ll be the jewel at the prachin,&rsquo; sir, plase Goodness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another reminded him of &ldquo;how often he proved Phaidrick Murray to be an
      ass, and showed him how he couldn&rsquo;t make out the differ atween black an&rsquo; 
      white.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; he did,&rdquo; said Phadrick, scratching his head, for he was one of
      the first at the house; &ldquo;an&rsquo; no wondher, wid his long-headed screwtations
      from the books. Throth, his own father was the best match, barrin&rsquo; Father
      Lawdher that was broke of his bread, he ever met wid, till he got too many
      for him by the Latin an&rsquo; Greek.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This allusion to old Denis occasioned his absence to be noticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can nobody tell where Denis More is?&rdquo; said the wife; &ldquo;my gracious, but
      it&rsquo;s quare he should be from about the place this day, any way. Brian,
      mavourneen, did you see him goin&rsquo; any where?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Brian, &ldquo;but I see him comin&rsquo; down there carryin&rsquo; some aitables
      in a basket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brian had scarcely ended when his father entered, bearing beef and mutton,
      as aforesaid, both of which he deposited upon the kitchen table, with a
      jerk of generosity and pride, that seemed to say, as he looked
      significantly at Denny&mdash;and, in fact, as he did say afterwards&mdash;&ldquo;Never
      spare, Dinny; ate like a gintleman; make yourself as bright an&rsquo; ginteel as
      you can; you won&rsquo;t want for beef an&rsquo; mutton!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Denis now sat down, and, after wiping the perspiration from his
      forehead, took the glass of poteen which the wife handed him: he held it
      between his finger and thumb for a moment, glanced around him upon the
      happy faces present, then laid it down again, fixed his eyes upon his son,
      and cast them once more upon the company. The affectionate father&rsquo;s heart
      was full; his breast heaved, and the large tears rolled slowly down his
      cheeks. By a strong effort, however, he mastered his emotion; and taking
      the glass again, he said in broken voice:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neighbors!&mdash;God bless yez!&mdash;God bless yez!&mdash;Dinny&mdash;Dinny&mdash;I&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The last words he pronounced with difficulty; and drinking off his glass,
      set it down empty upon the table. He then rose up, and shook his neighbors
      by the hand&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;a happy man, no doubt of it, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;re all happy; an&rsquo; 
      it&rsquo;s proud any father might be to hear the account of his son, that I did
      of mine, as I was convoyin&rsquo; Father Finnerty a piece o&rsquo; the way home. &lsquo;Your
      son,&rsquo; says he, when he took that bit of a coult out o&rsquo; my hand, &lsquo;will be
      an honor to you all. I tell you,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;that he&rsquo;s nearly as good a
      scholar, as myself, an&rsquo; spakes Latin not far behind my own; an&rsquo; as for a
      pracher,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;I can tell you that he&rsquo;ll be hard farther nor any man
      I know.&rsquo; He tould me them words wid his own two lips. An&rsquo; surely,
      neighbors,&rdquo; said he, relapsing into strong feeling, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t blame me
      for bein&rsquo; both proud and happy of sich a son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My readers, from the knowledge already given them of Denny&rsquo;s character,
      are probably disposed to think that his learning was thrown out on this
      occasion in longer words and more copious quotations than usual. This,
      however, was not the case; so far from that, he never displayed less
      pedantry, nor interspersed his conversation with fewer scraps of Latin. In
      fact, the proceedings of the day appeared to affect him with a tone of
      thought, decidedly at variance with the exuberance of joy experienced by
      the family. He was silent, moody, and evidently drawn by some secret
      reflection from the scene around him. He held a book in his hand, into
      which he looked from time to time, with the air of a man who balances some
      contingency in his mind. At length, when the conversation of those who
      were assembled became more loud and boisterous, he watched an opportunity
      of gliding out unperceived; having accomplished this, he looked cautiously
      about him, and finding himself not observed, he turned his steps to a glen
      which lay about half a mile below his father&rsquo;s house.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the lowest skirt of this little valley, protected, by a few spreading
      hawthorns, stood a small white farm-house, more immediately shaded by a
      close row of elder or boor-tree, which hung over one of the gables, and
      covered the garden gate, together with a neat grassy seat, that was built
      between the gate, and the gable. It was impervious to sun and rain: one of
      those pretty spots which present themselves on the road-side in the
      country, and strike the eye with a pleasing notion of comfort; especially
      when, during a summer shower, the cocks and hens of the little yard are
      seen by the traveller who takes shelter under it, huddled up in silence,
      the white dust quite dry, whilst the heavy shower patters upon the leaves
      above, and upon the dark drenched road beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the shade of this sat an interesting girl, aged about seventeen,
      named Susan Connor. She was slender, and not above the middle size; but
      certainly, in point of form and feature, such as might be called beautiful&mdash;handsome
      she unquestionably was; but be that as it may, with this rustic beauty the
      object of Denis&rsquo;s stolen visit was connected. She sat knitting under the
      shade of elder which we have described, a sweet picture of innocence and
      candor. Our hero&rsquo;s face, as he approached her, was certainly a fine study
      for any one who wished to embody the sad and the ludicrous. Desperate was
      the conflict between pedantry and feeling which he experienced. His manner
      appeared more pompous and affected than ever; yet was there blended with
      the flush of approaching triumph as a candidate, such woe-begone shades of
      distress flitting occasionally across his feature, as rendered his
      countenance inscrutably enigmatical.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the usual interchange of preliminary conversation had passed, Denis
      took his seat beside her on the grassy bench; and after looking in several
      directions, and giving half a dozen hems, he thus accosted her:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Susan, cream of my affections, I may venture to conjecture that the fact,
      or <i>factum</i>, of my being the subject of <i>fama clamosa</i> today,
      has not yet reached your ears?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Denis, you are at your deep larning from the books again. Can&rsquo;t you
      keep your reading for them that undherstands it, an&rsquo; not be spakin&rsquo; so
      Englified to a simple girl like me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is logic in that same, however. Do you know, Susan, I have often
      thought that, provided always you had resaved proper instruction, you
      would have made a first-rate classical scholar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you tould me, Denis, the Sunday we exchanged the promise. But sure
      when you get me, I can larn it. Won&rsquo;t you tache me, Denis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned her laughing eyes archly at him as she spoke, with a look of
      joy and affection: it was a look, indeed, that staggered for the moment
      every ecclesiastical resolution within him. He returned her glance, and
      ran over the features of her pure and beautiful countenance for some
      minutes; then, placing his open hand upon his eyes, he seemed buried in
      reflection. At length he addressed her:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Susan, I am thinking of that same Sunday evening on which we exchanged
      the hand-promise. I say, Susan,&mdash;<i>dimidium animae meae</i>&mdash;I
      am in the act of meditating upon it; and sorry am I to be compel&mdash;to
      be under the neces&mdash;to be reduced, I say&mdash;that is redact as in
      the larned langua&mdash;: in other words&mdash;or terms, indeed, is more
      elegant&mdash;in other terms, then, Susan, I fear that what I just now
      alluded to, touching the <i>fama clamosa</i> which is current about me
      this day, will render that promise a rather premature one on both our
      parts. Some bachelors in my situation might be disposed to call it
      foolish, but I entertain a reverence&mdash;a veneration for the feelings
      of the feminine sex, that inclines me to use the mildest and most
      classical language in divulging the change that has taken place in my
      fortunes since I saw you last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mane, Denis?&rdquo; inquired Susan, suddenly ceasing to knit, and
      fixing her eyes upon him with a glance of alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be plain, Susy, I find that Maynooth is my destination. It has been
      arranged between my father and Docthor Finnerty, that I must become a
      laborer in the vineyard; that is, that I must become a priest, and
      cultivate the grape. It&rsquo;s a sore revelation to make to an amorous maiden;
      but destiny will be triumphant:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Tempora mutantur, nos et mutamur in illis</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor girl suddenly laid down the work on which she had been engaged,
      her face became the color of ashes, and the reply she was about to make
      died upon her lips. She again resumed her stocking, but almost instantly
      laid it down a second time, and appeared wholly unable either to believe
      or comprehend what he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Denis,&rdquo; she at length asked, &ldquo;Did you say that all is to be over between
      us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was my insinuation,&rdquo; replied Denis, &ldquo;The fact is, Susy, that destiny
      is adverse; clean against our union in the bonds of matrimonial ecstacy.
      But, Susy, my charmer, I told you before that you were not destitute of
      logic, and I hope you will bear this heavy visitation as becomes a
      philosopher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bear it, Denis! How ought I to bear it, after your saying and swearing,
      too, that neither father, nor mother, nor priest, nor anybody else would
      make you desart me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Susan, my nightingale, perhaps you are not aware that there is an
      authority in existence to which father, mother, and all must knuckle down.
      That is the church, Susan. Reflect&mdash;<i>dulce decus meum</i>&mdash;that
      the power of the church is able to loose and unloose, to tie and untie, to
      forgive and to punish, to raise to the highest heaven, or to sink to the
      profoundest Tartarus. That power, Susan, thinks proper to claim your
      unworthy and enamored swain as one of the brightest Colossuses of her
      future glory. The Irish hierarchy is plased to look upon me as a luminary
      of almost superhuman brilliancy and coruscation: my talents she pronounces
      to be of the first magnitude; my eloquence classical and overwhelming, and
      my learning only adorned by that poor insignificant attribute denominated
      by philosophers unfathomability!&mdash;hem!&mdash;hem!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Denis,&rdquo; replied the innocent girl, &ldquo;you sometimes speak that I can
      undherstand you; but you oftener spake in a way that I can hardly make out
      what you say. If it&rsquo;s a thing that my love for you, or the solemn promise
      that passed between us, would stand in your light, or prevint you from
      higher things as a priest, I am willing to&mdash;to&mdash;to give you up,
      whatever I may suffer. But you know yourself, that you brought me on from
      time to time undher your promise, that nothing would ever lead you to lave
      me in sorrow an&rsquo; disappointment. Still, I say, that&mdash;But, Denis, is
      it thrue that you could lave me for anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The innocent confidence in his truth expressed by the simplicity of her
      last question, staggered the young candidate; that is to say, her words,
      her innocence, and her affection sank deeply into his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Susan,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;to tell the blessed truth, I am fairly dilemma&rsquo;d. My
      heart is in your favor; but&mdash;but&mdash;hem&mdash;you don&rsquo;t know the
      prospect that is open to me. You don&rsquo;t know the sin of keeping back such a&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;galaxy
      as I am from the church. I say you don&rsquo;t know the sin of it. That&rsquo;s the
      difficulty. If it was a common case it would be nothing! but to keep back
      a person like me&mdash;a <i>rara avis in terris</i>&mdash;from the
      priesthood, is a sin that requires a great dale of interest with the Pope
      to have absolved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven above forgive me!&rdquo; exclaimed the artless girl. &ldquo;In that case I
      wouldn&rsquo;t for the riches of the wide earth stand between you and. God. But
      I didn&rsquo;t know that before, Denis; and if you had tould me, I think, sooner
      than get into sich a sin I&rsquo;d struggle to keep down my love for you, even
      although my heart should break.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor darling,&rdquo; said Denis, taking her passive hand in his, &ldquo;and would it
      go so hard with you? Break your heart! Do you love me so well as that,
      Susan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susan&rsquo;s eyes turned on him for a moment, and the tears which his question
      drew forth gave it a full and a touching reply. She uttered not a word,
      but after a few deep sobs wiped her eyes, and endeavored to compose her
      feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denis felt the influence of her emotions; he remained silent for a short
      time, during which, however, ambition drew in the background all those
      dimly splendid visions that associate themselves with the sacerdotal
      functions, in a country where the people place no bounds to the spiritual
      power of their pastors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Susan,&rdquo; said he, after a pause, &ldquo;do you know the difference between a
      Christian and a hathen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between a Christian an&rsquo; a hathen? Why aren&rsquo;t hathens all sinners?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very right. Faith, Susan, you would have shone at the classics. You see
      <i>dilecta cordis mei,</i> or, <i>cordi meo,</i> for either is good
      grammar&mdash;you see, Susan, the difference between a Christian and a
      hathen is this:&mdash; a Christian bears disappointments, with fortitude&mdash;with
      what is denominated Christian fortitude; whereas, on the contrary, a
      hathen doesn&rsquo;t bear disappointments at all. Now, Susan, it would cut me to
      the heart to find that you would become a hathen on this touching and
      trying occasion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pray to God, Denis. Isn&rsquo;t that the way to act under afflictions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decidedly. There is no other legitimate mode of quelling a heart-ache.
      And, Susan, when you go to supplication you are at liberty to mention my
      name&mdash;no, not yet; but if I were once consecrated you might. However,
      it is better to sink this; say nothing about me when you pray, for, to
      tell you I truth, I believe you have as much influence above&mdash;<i>super
      astra</i>&mdash;as I have. There is one argument which I am anxious to
      press upon you. It is a very simple but a very respectable one after all.
      I am not all Ireland. You will find excellent good husbands even in this
      parish. There is, as the old proverb says, as good fish in the say as ever
      were caught. Do you catch one of them. For me, Susan, the vineyard claims
      me; I must, as I said, cultivate the grape. We must, consequently&mdash;hem!&mdash;we
      must&mdash;hem!&mdash;hem!&mdash;consequently strive to forget&mdash;hem!&mdash;I
      say, to forget each other. It is a trial&mdash;I know&mdash;a desperte
      visitation, poor fawn, upon your feelings; but, as I said, destiny will be
      triumphant. What is decreed, is decreed&mdash;I must go to Maynooth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susan rose, and her eyes flashed with an indignant sense of the
      cold-blooded manner in which he advised her to select another husband. She
      was an illiterate girl, but the purity of her feeling supplied the
      delicacy which reading and a knowledge of more refined society would have
      given her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it from your lips, Denis,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that I hear sich a mane and
      low-minded an advice? Or do you think that with my weak, and I now see,
      foolish heart, settled upon you, I could turn round and fix my love upon
      the first that might ax me? Denis, you promised before God to be mine, and
      mine only; you often said and swore that you loved me above any human
      being; but I now see that you only intended to lead me into sin and
      disgrace, for indeed, and before God I don&rsquo;t think&mdash;I don&rsquo;t&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t&mdash;believe that you ever loved me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A burst of grief, mingled with indignation and affliction, followed the
      words she had uttered. Denis felt himself called on for a vindication, and
      he was resolved to give it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Susan,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;your imagination is erroneous. By all the classical
      authors that ever were written, you are antipodialry opposed to facts.
      What harm is there, seeing that you and I can never be joined in wedlock&mdash;what
      harm is there, I say, in recommending you another husb&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susan would hear no more. She gathered up her stocking and ball of thread,
      placed them in her apron, went into her father&rsquo;s house, shut and bolted
      the door, and gave way to violent grief. All this occurred in a moment,
      and Denis found himself excluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not wish, however, to part from her in anger; so, after having
      attempted to look through the, keyhole of the door, and applied his eye in
      vain to the window, he at length spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any body within but yourself, Susy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He received no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Susy&mdash;<i>dilecta juventutis meae</i>&mdash;touching the
      recommendation&mdash;now don&rsquo;t be crying&mdash;touching the recommendation
      of another husband, by all the classics that ever were mistranslated, I
      meant nothing but the purest of consolation. If I did, may I be reduced to
      primeval and aboriginal ignorance! But you know yourself, that they never
      prospered who prevented a <i>rara avis</i> like me from entering the
      church&mdash;from laboring in the vineyard, and cultivating the grape.
      Don&rsquo;t be hathenish; but act with a philosophy suitable to so dignified an
      occasion&mdash;Farewell! <i>Macte virtute</i>, and be firm. I swear again
      by all the class&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of a neighbor caused him to cut short his oath. Seeing that
      the man approached the house, he drew off, and returned home, more
      seriously affected by Susan&rsquo;s agitation than he was willing to admit even
      to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      This triumph over his affection was, in fact, only the conquest of one
      passion over another. His attachment to Susan Connor was certainly
      sincere, and ere the prospects of his entering Maynooth were unexpectedly
      brought near him, by the interference of Father Finnerty, his secret
      purpose all along had been to enter with her into the state of matrimony,
      rather than into the church. Ambition, however, is beyond all comparison
      the most powerful principle of human conduct, and so Denny found it.
      Although his unceremonious abandonment of Susan appeared heartless and
      cruel, yet it was not effected on his part without profound sorrow and
      remorse. The two principles, when they began to struggle in his heart for
      supremacy, resembled the rival destinies of Caesar and Mark Antony. Love
      declined in the presence of ambition; and this, in proportion as all the
      circumstances calculated to work upon the strong imagination of a young
      man naturally fond of power, began to assume an appearance of reality. To
      be, in the course of a few years, a <i>bona fide</i> priest; to possess
      unlimited sway over the fears and principles of the people; to be endowed
      with spiritual gifts to he knew not what extent; and to enjoy himself as
      he had an opportunity of seeing Father Finnerty and his curate do, in the
      full swing of convivial pleasure, upon the ample hospitality of those who,
      in addition to this, were ready to kiss the latchet of his shoes&mdash;were,
      it must be admitted, no inconsiderable motives in influencing the conduct
      of a person reared in an humble condition of life. The claims of poor
      Susan, her modesty, her attachment, and her beauty&mdash;were all
      insufficient to prevail against such a host of opposing motives; and the
      consequence, though bitter, and subversive of her happiness, was a final
      determination on the part of Denny, to acquaint her, with a kind of <i>ex-officio</i>
      formality, that all intercourse upon the subject of their mutual
      attachment must cease between them. Notwithstanding his boasted knowledge,
      however, he was ignorant of sentiment, and accordingly confined himself,
      as I have intimated, to a double species of argument; that is to say,
      first, the danger and sin of opposing the wishes of the church which had
      claimed him, as he said, to labor in the vineyard; and secondly, the
      undoubted fact, that there were plenty of good husbands besides himself in
      the world, from some one of which, he informed her, he had no doubt, she
      could be accommodated.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, her image, meek, and fair, and uncomplaining, would from
      time to time glide into his imagination; and the melody of her voice send
      its music once more to his vaccillating heart. He usually paused then, and
      almost considered himself under the influence of a dream; but ambition,
      with its train of shadowy honors, would immediately present itself, and
      Susan was again forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he rejoined the company, to whom he had given the slip, he found them
      all gone, except about six or eight whom his father had compelled to stop
      for dinner. His mind was now much lighter than it had been before his
      interview with Susan, nor were his spirits at all depressed by perceiving
      that a new knife and fork lay glittering upon the dresser for his own
      particular use.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, thin, where have you been all this time,&rdquo; said the father, &ldquo;an&rsquo; we
      wantin&rsquo; to know whether you&rsquo;d like the mutton to be boiled or roasted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was soliloquizing in the glen below,&rdquo; replied Denny, once more assuming
      his pedantry, &ldquo;meditating upon the transparency of all human events; but
      as for the beef and mutton, I advise you to boil the beef, and roast the
      mutton, or vice versa, to boil the mutton, and roast the beef. But I
      persave my mother has anticipated me, and boiled them both with that
      flitch of bacon that&rsquo;s playing the vagrant in the big pot there. <i>Tria
      juncla in uno</i>, as Horace says in the Epodes, when expatiating upon the
      Roman Emperors&mdash;ehem!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Misther Denis,&rdquo; said one of those present, &ldquo;maybe you&rsquo;d tell us upon the
      watch, what the hour is, if you plase, sir; myself never can know right at
      all, except by the shadow of the sun from the corner of our own gavel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; replied Denis, pulling it out with much pomp of manner, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just
      half-past two to a quarter of a minute, and a few seconds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why thin what a quare thing entirely a watch is,&rdquo; the other continued;
      &ldquo;now what makes you hould it to your ear, Misther Denis, if you plase?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The efficient cause of that, Larry, is, that the drum of the ear, you
      persave&mdash;the drum of the ear&mdash;is enabled to catch the
      intonations produced by the machinery of its internal operations&mdash;otherwise
      the fact of applying it to the ear would be unnecessary&mdash;altogether
      unnecessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! see what it is to have the knowledge, any way! But isn&rsquo;t it
      quare how it moves of itself like a livin&rsquo; crathur? How is that, Misther
      Denis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Larry,&mdash;ehem&mdash;you see the motions of it are&mdash;that is&mdash;the
      works or operations, are all continually going; and sure it is from that
      explanation that we say a watch goes well. That&rsquo;s more than you ever knew
      before, Larry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed it surely is, sir, an&rsquo; is much oblaged to you, Misther Denis; sure
      if I ever come to wear a watch in my fob, I&rsquo;ll know something about it,
      anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the remainder of that day Denis was as learned and consequential as
      ever; his friends, when their hearts were opened by his father&rsquo;s
      hospitality, all promised him substantial aid in money, and in presents of
      such articles as they supposed might be serviceable to him in Maynooth.
      Denny received their proffers of support with suitable dignity and
      gratitude. A scene of bustle and preparation now commenced among them, nor
      was Denny himself the least engaged; for it somehow happened, that
      notwithstanding his profound erudition, he felt it necessary to read night
      or day in order to pass with more eclat the examination which he had to
      stand before the bishop ere his appointment to Maynooth. This ordeal was
      to occur upon a day fixed for the purpose, in the ensuing month; and
      indeed Denis occupied as much of the intervening period in study as his
      circumstances would permit. His situation was, at this crisis, certainly
      peculiar. Every person related to him in the slightest degree contrived to
      revive their relationship; his former school-fellows, on hearing that he
      was actually destined to be of the church, renewed their acquaintance with
      him, and those who had been servants to his father, took the liberty of
      speaking to him upon the strength of that fact. No child, to the remotest
      shade of affinity, was born, for which he did not stand godfather; nieces
      and nephews thickened about him, all with remarkable talents, and many of
      them, particularly of the nieces, said to be exceedingly genteel&mdash;very
      thrifty for their ages, and likely to make excellent housekeepers. A
      strong likeness to himself was also pointed out in the features of his
      nephews, one of whom had his born nose&mdash;another his eyes&mdash;and a
      third again had his brave high-flown way with him. In short, he began to
      feel some of the inconveniences of greatness; and, like it, to be
      surrounded by cringing servility and meanness. When he went to the chapel
      he was beset, and followed from place to place, by a retinue of friends
      who were all anxious to secure to themselves the most conspicuous marks of
      his notice. It was the same thing in fair or market; they contended with
      each other who should do him most honor, or afford to him and his father&rsquo;s
      immediate family the most costly treat, accompanied by the grossest
      expressions of flattery. Every male infant born among them was called
      Dionysius; and every female one Susan, after his favorite sister. All
      this, to a lad like Denis, already remarkable for his vanity, was very
      trying; or rather, it absolutely turned his brain, and made him probably
      as finished a specimen of pride, self-conceit, and domineering arrogance,
      mingled with a kind of lurking humorous contempt for his cringing
      relations, as could be displayed in the person of some shallow but knavish
      prime minister, surrounded by his selfish sycophants, whom he encourages
      and despises.

      At home he was idolized&mdash;overwhelmed with respect and deference. The
      slightest intimation of his wish was a command to them; the beef, and
      fowl, and mutton, were at hand in all the variety of culinary skill, and
      not a soul in the house durst lay a hand upon his knife and fork but
      himself. In the morning, when the family were to be seen around the
      kitchen table at their plain but substantial breakfast, Denis was lording
      it in solitary greatness over an excellent breakfast of tea and eggs in
      another room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now, too, that the king&rsquo;s English, as well as the mutton, was
      carved and hacked to some purpose; epithets prodigiously long and foreign
      to the purpose were pressed into his conversation, for no other reason
      than because those to whom he spoke could not understand them; but the
      principal portion of his time was devoted to study. The bishop, he had
      heard, was a sound scholar, and exceedingly scrupulous in recommending any
      to Maynooth, except such as were well versed in the preparatory course.
      Independently of this, he was anxious, he said, to distinguish himself in
      his examination, and, if possible, to sustain as high a character with the
      bishop and his fellow-students, as he did among the peasantry of his own
      neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the day approached. The bishop&rsquo;s residence was not distant more
      than a few hours&rsquo; ride, and he would have sufficient time to arrive there,
      pass his examination, and return in time for dinner. On the eve of his
      departure, old Denis invited Father Finnerty, his curate and about a dozen
      relations and friends, to dine with him the next day; when&mdash;Denis
      having surmounted the last obstacle to the accomplishment of his hopes&mdash;their
      hearts could open without a single reflection to check the exuberance of
      their pride, hospitality, and happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have often said to my friends, and I now repeat it in print, that after
      all there is no people bound up so strongly to each other by the ties of
      domestic life as the Irish. On the night which preceded this joyous and
      important day, a spirit of silent but tender affection dwelt in every
      heart of the O&rsquo;Shaughnessys. The great point of interest was Denis. He
      himself was serious, and evidently labored under that strong anxiety so
      natural to a youth in his circumstances. A Roman Catholic bishop, too, is
      a personage looked upon by the people with a kind of feeling that embodies
      in it awe, reverence, and fear. Though, in this country, an humble man
      possessing neither the rank in society, outward splendor, nor the gorgeous
      profusion of wealth and pomp which characterize a prelate of the
      Established Church; yet it is unquestionable that the gloomy dread, and
      sense of formidable power with which they impress the minds of the
      submissive peasantry, immeasurably surpass the more legitimate influence
      which any Protestant dignitary could exercise over those who stand, with
      respect to him, in a more rational and independent position.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not surprising that Denis, who practised upon ignorant people that
      petty despotism for which he was so remarkable, should now, on coming in
      contact with great spiritual authority, adopt his own principles, and
      relapse from the proud pedant into the cowardly slave. True it is that he
      presented a most melancholy specimen of independence in a crisis where
      moral courage was so necessary; but his dread of the coming day was
      judiciously locked up in his own bosom. His silence and apprehension were
      imputed to the workings of a mind learnedly engaged in arranging the vast
      stores of knowledge with which it was so abundantly stocked; his moody
      picture of the bishop&rsquo;s brow; his reflection that he was going before so
      sacred a person, as a candidate for the church, with his heart yet
      redolent of earthly affection for Susan Connor; his apprehension that the
      bishop&rsquo;s spiritual scent might sagaciously smell it out, were all put down
      by the family to the credit of uncommon learning, which, as his mother
      observed truly, &ldquo;often makes men do quare things.&rdquo; His embarrassments,
      however, inasmuch as they were ascribed by them to wrong causes, endeared
      him more to their hearts than ever. Because he spoke little, neither the
      usual noise nor bustle of a large family disturbed the silence of the
      house; every word was uttered that evening in a low tone, at once
      expressive of tenderness and respect. The family supper was tea, in
      compliment to Denis; and they all partook of it with him. Nothing humbles
      the mind, and gives the natural feelings their full play, so well as a
      struggle in life, or the appearance of its approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Denis,&rdquo; said the father, &ldquo;the time will come when we won&rsquo;t have you at
      all among us; but, thank goodness, you&rsquo;ll be in a betther place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis heard him not, and consequently made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say Maynewth&rsquo;s a tryin&rsquo; place, too,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d be sorry
      to see him pulled down to anatomy, like some of the scarecrows that come
      qut of it. I hope you&rsquo;ll bear it betther.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you speak to me?&rdquo; said Denis, awaking out of a reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, sir,&rdquo; replied the father; and as he uttered the words the son
      perceived that his eyes were fixed upon him with an expression of
      affectionate sorrow and pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth was then in a serious mood, free from all the dominion of that
      learned mania under which he had so frequently signalized himself: the
      sorrow of his father, and a consciousness of the deep affection and
      unceasing kindness which he had ever experienced from him, joined to a
      recollection of their former friendly disputes and companionship, touched
      Denny to the quick. But the humility with which he applied to him the
      epithet sir, touched him most. What! thought he&mdash;ought my
      affectionate father to be thrown to such a distance from a son, who owes
      everything to his love and goodness! The thought of his stooping so humbly
      before him smote the boy&rsquo;s heart, and the tears glistened in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you have been kind and good to me, beyond my deserts;
      surely then I cannot bear to hear you address me in that manner, as if we
      were both strangers. Nor while I am with you, shall any of you so address
      me. Remember that I am still your son and their brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The natural affection displayed in this speech soon melted the whole
      family into tears&mdash;not excepting Denis himself, who felt that grief
      which we experience when about to be separated for the first time from
      those we love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come over, avourneen,&rdquo; said his mother, drying her eyes with the corner
      of her check apron: &ldquo;come over, <i>acushla machree</i>, an&rsquo; sit beside me:
      sure although we&rsquo;re sorry for you, Denis, it&rsquo;s proud our hearts are of
      you, an&rsquo; good right we have, a sullish! Come over, an let me be near you
      as long as I can, any way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis placed himself beside her, and the proud mother drew his head over
      upon her bosom, and bedewed his face with a gush of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say,&rdquo; she observed, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s sinful to shed tears when there&rsquo;s no
      occasion for grief; but I hope it&rsquo;s no sin to cry when one&rsquo;s heart is full
      of somethin&rsquo; that brings them to one&rsquo;s eyes, whether they will or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mave,&rdquo; said the father, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll miss him more nor any of you: but sure
      he&rsquo;ll often send letters to us from Maynewth, to tell us now he&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; 
      on; an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll be proud enough, never fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll miss me, Denis,&rdquo; said his favorite sister, who was also called
      Susan; &ldquo;for you&rsquo;ll find no one in Maynewth that will keep your linen so
      white as I did: but never fear, I&rsquo;ll be always knittin&rsquo; you stockings; an&rsquo; 
      every year I&rsquo;ll make you half-a-dozen shirts, and you&rsquo;ll think them more
      natural nor other shirts, when you know they came from your own home&mdash;from
      them that you love! Won&rsquo;t you, Denis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, Susy; and I will love the shirts for the sake of the hands that
      made them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I won&rsquo;t allow Susy Connor to help me as she used to do: they&rsquo;ll be
      all Alley&rsquo;s sewin&rsquo; and mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor colleen&mdash;listen to her!&rdquo; exclaimed the affectionate father;
      &ldquo;indeed you will, Susy; ay, and hem his cravats, that we&rsquo;ll send him ready
      made an&rsquo; all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Denis, &ldquo;but as to Susy Connor&mdash;hem&mdash;why, upon
      considera&mdash;he&mdash;hem&mdash;upon second thoughts, I don&rsquo;t see why
      you should prevent her from helping you; she&rsquo;s a neighbor&rsquo;s daughter, and
      a well-wisher, of whose prosperity in life I&rsquo;d always wish to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor girl&rsquo;s very bad in her health, for the last three weeks,&rdquo;
       observed his other sister Alley: &ldquo;she has lost her appetite, an&rsquo; is cast
      down entirely in her spirits. You ought to go an&rsquo; see her, Denis, before
      you set out for the college, if it was only on her dacent father&rsquo;s
      account. When I was tellin&rsquo; her yisterday that you wor to get the bishop&rsquo;s
      letter for Maynewth to-morrow, she was in so poor a state of health that
      she nearly fainted. I had to give her a drink of wather, and sprinkle her
      face with it. Well, she&rsquo;s a purty crathur, an&rsquo; a good girl, an&rsquo; was always
      that, dear knows!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Denis achree,&rdquo; said his mother, somewhat alarmed, &ldquo;are you any way
      unwell? Why your heart&rsquo;s batin&rsquo; like a new catched chicken! Are you sick,
      acushla; or are you used to this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t signify,&rdquo; replied Denis, gently raising himself from his
      mother&rsquo;s arms, &ldquo;I will sit up, mother; it&rsquo;s but a sudden stroke or two of
      <i>tremor cordis</i>, produced probably by having my mind too much upon
      one object.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said his father, &ldquo;he will be the betther of a little drop of
      the poteen made into punch, an&rsquo; for that matter we can all take a sup of
      it; as there&rsquo;s no one here but ourselves, we will have it snug an&rsquo; 
      comfortable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing resembles an April day more than the general disposition of the
      Irish people. When old Denis&rsquo;s proposal for the punch was made, the gloom
      which hung over the family&mdash;originating, as it did, more in joy than
      in soitow&mdash;soon began to disappear. Their countenances gradually
      brightened, by and by mirth stole out, and ere the punch had accomplished
      its first round, laughter, and jest, and good-humor,&mdash;each, in
      consequence of the occasion, more buoyant and vivacious than usual, were
      in full play. Denis himself, when animated by the unexcised liquor, threw
      off his dejection, and&rsquo; ere the night was half spent found himself in the
      highest region of pedantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;turn my back upon any other candidate in the
      province, in point of preparatory excellence and ardency of imagination. I
      say, sitting here beside you, my worthy and logical father, I would not
      retrograde from any candidate for the honors of the Catholic Church in the
      province&mdash;in the kingdom&mdash;in Europe; and it is not improbable
      but I might progradiate another step, and say Christendom at large. And
      now, what&rsquo;s a candidate? Father, you have some apprehension in you, and
      are a passable second-hand controversialist&mdash;what&rsquo;s a candidate? Will
      you tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give it up, Denis; but you&rsquo;ll tell us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will tell you. Candidate signifies a man dressed in fustian; it
      comes from <i>candidus</i>, which is partly Greek, partly Latin, and
      partly Hebrew. It was the learned designation for Irish linen, too, which
      in the time of the Romans was in great request at Home; but it was changed
      to signify fustian, because it was found that everything a man promised on
      becoming a candidate for any office, turned out to be only fustian when he
      got it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Denis, avourneen,&rdquo; said his mother, &ldquo;the greatest comfort myself has is
      to be thinkin&rsquo; that when you&rsquo;re a priest, you can be sayin&rsquo; masses for my
      poor sinful sowl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there is undoubtedly comfort in, that reflection; and depend upon
      it, my dear mother, that I&rsquo;ll be sure to clinch your masses in the surest
      mode. I&rsquo;ll not fly over them like Camilla across a field of potato oats,
      without discommoding a single walk, as too many of my worthy brethren&mdash;I
      mane as! too many of those whose worthy brother I will soon be&mdash;do in
      this present year of grace. I&rsquo;m no fool at the Latin, but, as I&rsquo;m an
      unworthy candidate for Maynooth, I cannot even understand every fifteenth
      word they say when reading mass, independently of the utter scorn with
      which they treat; these two Scholastic old worthies, called! Syntax and
      Prosody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Denis,&rdquo; said the father, &ldquo;nothing would give me greater delight than to
      be present at your first mass, an&rsquo; your first sarmon; and next to that I
      would like to be stumpin&rsquo; about wid a dacent staff in my hand, maybe wid a
      bit of silver on the head of it, takin&rsquo; care of your place when you&rsquo;d have
      a parish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events, if you&rsquo;re not with me, father, I&rsquo;ll keep you comfortable
      wherever you&rsquo;ll be, whether in this world or the other; for, plase
      goodness, I&rsquo;ll have some influence in both.&mdash;When I get a parish,
      however, it is not improbable that I may have occasion to see company; the
      neighboring gentlemen will be apt to relish my society, particularly those
      who are addicted to conviviality; and our object will be to render
      ourselves as populous as possible; now, whether in that case it would be
      compatible&mdash;but never fear, father, whilst I have the means, you or
      one of the family shall never want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you let the people be far behind in their dues, Denis?&rdquo; inquired
      Brian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no&mdash;leave that point to my management. Depend upon it, I&rsquo;ll have
      them like mice before me&mdash;ready to run into the first augerhole they
      meet. I&rsquo;ll collect lots of oats, and get as much yarn every year as would
      clothe three regiments of militia, or, for that matther, of dragoons. I&rsquo;ll
      appoint my stations, too, in the snuggest farmers&rsquo; houses in the parish,
      just as Father Finnerty, our worthy parochial priest, ingeniously
      contrives to do. And, to revert secondarily to the collection of the oats,
      I&rsquo;ll talk liberally to the Protestant boddaghs; give the Presbyterians a
      learned homily upon civil and religious freedom: make hard hits with them
      at that Incubus, the Established Church; and, never fear, but I shall fill
      bag after bag with good corn from many of both creeds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Brian, &ldquo;will be givin&rsquo; them the bag to hould in airnest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Brian, but it will be makin&rsquo; them fill the bag when I hold it, which
      will be better still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Susan, &ldquo;who&rsquo;ll keep house for you? You know that a priest
      can&rsquo;t live widout a housekeeper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, Susy,&rdquo; replied Denis, &ldquo;is, and will be the most difficult point on
      which to accomplish anything like a satisfactory determination. I have
      nieces enough, however. There&rsquo;s Peter Finnegan&rsquo;s eldest daughter Mary, and
      Hugh Tracy&rsquo;s Ailsey&mdash;(to whom he added about a dozen and a half more)&mdash;together
      with several yet to be endowed with existence, all of whom will be brisk
      candidates for the situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; replied Mrs. O&rsquo;Shaughnessy, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;ll ever get any one
      who&rsquo;d be more comfortable about you nor your own ould mother. What do you
      think of takin&rsquo; myself, Denis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but consider the accomplishments in the culinary art&mdash;<i>in re
      vel in arte culinaria</i>&mdash;which will be necessary for my housekeeper
      to know. How would you, for instance, dress a dinner for the bishop if he
      happened to pay me a visit, as you may be certain he will? How would you
      make pies and puddings, and disport your fancy through all the varieties
      of roast and boil? How would you dress a fowl that it would stand upon a
      dish as if it was going to dance a hornpipe? How would you amalgamate the
      different genera of wine with boiling fluid and crystallized saccharine
      matter? How would you dispose of the various dishes upon the table
      according to high life and mathematics? Wouldn&rsquo;t you be too old to bathe
      my feet when I&rsquo;d be unwell? Wouldn&rsquo;t you be too old to bring me my whey in
      the morning soon as I&rsquo;d awake, perhaps with a severe headache, after the
      plenary indulgence of a clerical compotation? Wouldn&rsquo;t you be too old to
      sit up till the middle of the nocturnal hour, awaiting my arrival home?
      Wouldn&rsquo;t you be&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hut, tut, that&rsquo;s enough, Denny, I&rsquo;d never do at all. No, no, but I&rsquo;ll sit
      a clane, dacent ould woman in the corner upon a chair that you&rsquo;ll get made
      for me. There I&rsquo;ll be wid my pipe and tobacco, smokin&rsquo; at my aise,
      chattin&rsquo; to the sarvints, and sometimes discoorsin&rsquo; the neighbors that&rsquo;ll
      come to inquire for you, when they&rsquo;ll be sittin&rsquo; in the kitchen waitin&rsquo; 
      till you get through your office. Jist let me have that, Dinny achora, and
      I&rsquo;ll be as happy as the day&rsquo;s long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I on the other side,&rdquo; said his father, naturally enough struck with
      the happy simplicity of the picture which his wife drew, &ldquo;on the other
      side, Mave, a snug, dacent ould man, chattin&rsquo; to you across the fire,
      proud to see the bishop an&rsquo; the gintlemen about him. An&rsquo; I wouldn&rsquo;t ax to
      be taken into the parlor at all, except, maybe, when there would be nobody
      there but yourself, Denis; an&rsquo; that your mother an&rsquo; I would go into the
      parlor to get a glass of punch, or, if it could be spared, a little taste
      of wine for novelty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you shall, both of you&mdash;you, father, at one side of the hob,
      and my mother here at the other, the king and queen of my culinarian
      dominions. But practice taciturnity a little&mdash;I&rsquo;m visited by the
      muse, and must indulge in a strain of vocal melody&mdash;hem&mdash;&lsquo;tis a
      few lines of my own composure, the offspring of a moment of inspiration by
      the nine female Heliconians; but before I incipiate, here&rsquo;s to my own
      celebrity to-morrow, and afterwards all your healths!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then proceeded to sing in his best style a song composed, as he said,
      by himself, but which, as the composition was rather an eccentric one, we
      decline giving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Denis,&rdquo; said his brother, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have great sport at the Station&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Brian, most inimitable specimen of fraternity, I do look into the
      futurity of a station with great complacency. Hem&mdash;in the morning I
      rise up in imagination, and after reading part of my office, I and my
      curate&mdash;<i>ego et coadjutor metis</i>&mdash;or, if I get a large
      parish, perhaps I and my two curates&mdash;<i>ego et coudjutores mei</i>&mdash;order
      our horses, and of a fine, calm summer morning we mount them as gracefully
      as three throopers. The sun is up, and of coorse the moon is down, and the
      glitter of the light, the sparkling of the dew, the canticles of the
      birds, and the <i>melodiotis</i> cowing of the crows in Squire Grimshaw&rsquo;s
      rookery&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Denis, is it this parish you&rsquo;ll have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence, silence, till I complate my rural ideas&mdash;in some
      gentleman&rsquo;s rookery at all events; the thrush here, the blackbird there,
      the corn-craik chanting its varied note in another place, and so on. In
      the meantime we reverend sentimentalists advance, gazing with odoriferous
      admiration upon the prospect about us, and expatiating in the purest of
      Latin upon the beauties of unsophisticated nature. When we meet the
      peasants going out to their work, they put their hands to their hats for
      us; but as I am known to be the parochial priest, it is to me the
      salutation is directed, which I return with the air of a man who thinks
      nothing of such things; but, I on the contrary, knows them to be his due.
      The poor creatures of curates you must know, don&rsquo;t presume to speak of
      themselves, but simply answer whenever I condescend to propose
      conversation, for I&rsquo;ll keep them down, never fear. In this edifying style
      we proceed&mdash;I a few steps in advance, and they at a respectful
      distance behind me, the heads of their horses just to my saddle skirts&mdash;my
      clerical boots as brilliant as the countenance of Phoebus, when decked
      with rosy smiles, theirs more subordinately polished, for there should be
      gradations in all things, and humility is the first of virtues in a
      Christian curate. My bunch of gold sales stands out proudly from my
      anterior rotundity, for by this time, plase God, I&rsquo;ll be getting
      frolicsome and corpulent: they with only a poor bit of ribbon, and a
      single two-penny kay, stained with verdigrace. In the meantime, we come
      within sight of the wealthy farmer&rsquo;s house, wherein we are to hold the
      edifying solemnity of a station. There is a joyful appearance of study and
      bustle about the premises: the peasantry are flocking towards it, dressed
      in their best clothes; the proprietors of the mansion itself are running
      out to try if we are in appearance, and the very smoke disports itself
      hilariously in the air, and bounds up as if it was striving to catch the
      first glimpse of the clargy. When we approach, the good man&mdash;<i>pater-familias</i>&mdash;comes
      out to meet us, and the good woman&mdash;<i>mater-farmilias</i>&mdash;comes
      curtseying from the door to give the head <i>milliafailtha</i>. No sooner
      do we parsave ourselves noticed, then out comes the Breviary, and in a
      moment we are at our morning devotions. I being the rector, am
      particularly grave and dignified. I do not speak much, but am rather
      sharp, and order the curates, whom I treat, however, with great respect
      before the people, instantly to work. This impresses those who are present
      with awe and reverence for us all, especially for Father O&rsquo;Shaughnessy
      himself&mdash;(that&rsquo;s me).&mdash;I then take a short turn or two across
      the floor, silently perusing my office, after which I lay it aside, and
      relax into a little conversation with the people of the house, to show
      that I can conciliate by love as readily as I can impress them with fear;
      for, you see <i>divide et impera</i> is as aptly applied to the passions
      as to maxims of state policy&mdash;ehem. I then go to my tribunal, and
      first hear the man and woman and family of the house, and afther them the
      other penitents according as they can come to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus we go on absolving in great style, till it is time for the <i>matutinal</i>
      meal&mdash;vulgarly called breakfast; when the whiskey, eggs, toast, and
      tea as strong as Hercules, with ham, fowl, beef-steaks, or mutton-chops,
      all pour in upon us in the full tide of hospitality. Helter-skelter, cut
      and thrust, right and left, we work away, till the appetite reposes itself
      upon the cushion of repletion: and off we go once more, full an&rsquo; warm, to
      the delicate employment of adjudicating upon sin and transgression, until
      dinner comes, when, having despatched as many as possible&mdash;for the
      quicker we get through them the better&mdash;we set about despatching what
      is always worth a ship-load of such riff-raff&mdash;<i>videlicet</i>, a
      good and extensive dinner. Oh, ye pagan gods of eating and drinking,
      Bacchus and&mdash;let me see who the presiding deity of good feeding was
      in the Olympian synod&mdash;as I&rsquo;m an unworthy candidate I forget that
      topic of learning; but no matter, <i>non constat</i>. Oh, ye pagan
      professors of ating and drinking, Bacchus, and Epicurus, and St.
      Heliogabalus, Anthony of Padua, and Paul the Hermit, who poached for his
      own venison, St. Tuck, and St. Takem, St. Drinkem, and St. Eatem, with all
      the other reverend worthies, who bore the blushing honors of the table
      thick upon your noses, come and inspire your unworthy candidate, while he
      essays to chant the praises of a Station dinner!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, then, does the priest appropriate to himself his due share of
      enjoyment Then does he, like Elias, throw his garment of inspiration upon
      his coadjutors. Then is the goose cut up, and the farmer&rsquo;s distilled Latin
      is found to be purer and more edifying than the distillation of Maynooth.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &lsquo;Drink deep, or taste not that Pierian spring,
     A little learning here&rsquo;s a dangerous thing.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      And so it is, as far as this inspiring language is concerned. A station
      dinner is the very pinnacle of a priest&rsquo;s happiness. There is the fun and
      frolic; then does the lemon-juice of mirth and humor come out of their
      reverences, like secret writing, as soon as they get properly warm. The
      song and the joke, the laugh and the leer, the shaking of hands, the
      making of matches, and the projection of weddings,&mdash;och, I must
      conclude, or my brisk fancy will dissolve in the deluding vision! Here&rsquo;s
      to my celebrity to-morrow, and may the Bishop catch a Tartar in your son,
      my excellent and logical father!&mdash;as I tell you among ourselves he
      will do. Mark me, I say it, but it&rsquo;s <i>inter nos</i>, it won&rsquo;t go
      further; but should he trouble me with profundity, may be I&rsquo;ll make a <i>ludibrium</i>
      of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you forget the weddings and christenings, Denis; you&rsquo;ll have great
      sport at them too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember three things at a time, Brian; but you are mistaken,
      however, I had them snug in one corner of my cranium. The weddings and the
      christenings! do you think I&rsquo;ll have nothing to do in them, you! <i>stultus</i>
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Denis, is there any harm in the priests enjoying themselves, and
      they so holy as we know they are?&rdquo; inquired his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the least in life; considering what severe fasting, and great praying
      they have; besides it&rsquo;s necessary for them to take something to put the
      sins of the people out of their heads, and that&rsquo;s one reason why they are
      often jolly at Stations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My goodness, what light Denis can throw upon anything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not without deep study, mother; but let us have another portion of punch
      each, afther which I&rsquo;ll read a Latin De Profundis, and we&rsquo;ll go to bed, I
      must be up early tomorrow; and, Brian, you&rsquo;ll please to have the black
      mare saddled and my spur brightened as jinteely as you can, for I must go
      in as much state and grandeur as possible.&rdquo; Accordingly, in due time,
      after hearing the De Profundis, which Denis read in as sonorous a tone,
      and as pompous a manner, as he could assume, they went to bed for the
      night, to dream of future dignities for their relative.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Denis appeared the next morning, it was evident that the spirit of
      prophecy in which he had contemplated the enjoyments annexed to his ideal
      station on the preceding night, had departed from him. He was pale and
      anxious, as in the early part of the,previous evening. At breakfast, his
      very appetite treacherously abandoned him, despite the buttered toast and
      eggs which his mother forced upon him with such tender assiduity, in
      order, she said, to make him stout against the Bishop. Her solicitations,
      however, were vain; after attempting to eat to no purpose, he arose and
      began to prepare himself for his journey. This, indeed, was a work of
      considerable importance, for, as they had no looking-glass, he was obliged
      to dress himself over a tub of water, in which, since truth must be told,
      he saw a very cowardly visage. In due time, however, he was ready to
      proceed upon his journey, apparelled in a new suit of black that sat
      stiffly and awkwardly upon him, crumpled in a manner that enabled any
      person, at a glance, to perceive that it was worn for the first time. When
      he was setting out, his father approached him with a small jug of holy
      water in his hand. &ldquo;Denis,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I think you won&rsquo;t be the worse for a
      sprinkle of this;&rdquo; and he accordingly was about to shake it with a little
      brush over his person, when Denis arrested his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easy, father,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t remember that my new clothes are
      on. I&rsquo;ll just take a little with, my fingers, for you know one drop is as
      good as a thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; said the father, &ldquo;but on the other hand you know it&rsquo;s not
      lucky to refuse it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t refuse it,&rdquo; rejoined Denis, &ldquo;I surely took a quantum suff. of it
      with my own hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very near a refusal,&rdquo; said the father, in a disappointed and
      somewhat sorrowful tone; &ldquo;but it can&rsquo;t be helped now. I&rsquo;m only sorry you
      put it and quantum suff. in connection at all. Quantum suff. is what
      Father Finnerty says, when he will take no more punch; and it doesn&rsquo;t
      argue respect in you to make as little of a jug of holy wather as he does
      of a jug of punch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sarry for it too,&rdquo; replied Denis, who was every whit as superstitious
      as his father; &ldquo;and to atone for my error, I desire you will sprinkle me
      all over with it&mdash;clothes and all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The father complied with this, and Denis was setting out, when his mother
      exclaimed, &ldquo;Blessed be them above us, Denis More! Look at the boy&rsquo;s legs!
      There&rsquo;s luck! Why one of his stockin&rsquo;s has the wrong side out, and it&rsquo;s
      upon the right leg too! Well, this will be a fortunate day for you, Denis,
      any way; the same thing never happened myself, but something good followed
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This produced a slight conflict between Denis&rsquo;s personal vanity and
      superstition; but on this occasion superstition prevailed: he even felt
      his spirits considerably elevated by the incident, mounted the mare, and
      after jerking himself once or twice in the saddle, to be certain that all
      was right, he touched her with the spur, and set out to be examined by the
      Bishop, exclaiming as he went, &ldquo;Let his lordship take care that I don&rsquo;t
      make a <i>ludibrium</i> of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The family at that moment all came to the door, where they stood looking
      after, and admiring him, until he turned a corner of the road, and left
      their sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many were the speculations entered into during his absence, as to the
      fact, whether or not he would put down the bishop in the course of the
      examination; some of them holding that he could do so if he wished; but
      others of them denying that it was possible for him, inasmuch as he had
      never received holy orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day passed, but not in the usual way, in Denis More O&rsquo;Shaughnessy&rsquo;s.
      The females of the family were busily engaged in preparing for the dinner,
      to which Father Finnerty, his curate, and several of their nearest and
      wealthiest friends had been invited; and the men in clearing out the
      stables and other offices for the horses of the guests. Pride and
      satisfaction were visible on every face, and that disposition to
      cordiality and to the oblivion of everything unpleasant to the mind,
      marked, in a prominent manner, their conduct and conversation. Old Denis
      went, and voluntarily spoke to a neighbor, with whom he had not exchanged
      a word, except in anger, for some time. He found him at work in the field,
      and, advancing with open hand and heart, he begged his pardon for any
      offence he might have given him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is goin&rsquo; to Maynooth; and as he is a boy that we have
      a good right to be proud of, and as our friends are comin&rsquo; to ate their
      dinner wid us to-day, and as&mdash;as my heart is to full to bear ill-will
      against any livin&rsquo; sowl, let alone a man that I know to be sound at the
      heart, in spite of all that has come between us&mdash;I say, Darby, I
      forgive you, and I expect pardon for my share of the offence. There&rsquo;s the
      hand of an honest man&mdash;let us be as neighbors ought to be, and not
      divided into parties and factions against one another, as we have been too
      long. Take your dinner wid us to-day, and let us hear no more about
      ill-will and unkindness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Denis,&rdquo; said his friend, &ldquo;it ill becomes you to spake first. &lsquo;Tis I that
      ought to do that, and to do it long ago too; but you see, somehow, so long
      as it was to be decided by blows between the families, I&rsquo;d never give in.
      Not but that I might do so, but my sons, Denis, wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it.
      Throth, I&rsquo;m glad of this, and so will they too; for only for the honor and
      glory of houldin&rsquo; out, we might be all friends through other long ago. And
      I&rsquo;ll tell you what, we couldn&rsquo;t do better, the two factions of us, nor
      join and thrash them Haigneys that always put between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Darby, I tell you, I bear no ill-will, no bad thoughts agin any born
      Christian this day, and I won&rsquo;t hear of that. Come to us about five
      o&rsquo;clock: we&rsquo;re to have Father Finnerty, and Father Molony, his curate: all
      friends, man, all friends; and Denny, God guard him this day, will be
      home, afther passin&rsquo; the Bishop, about four o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always thought that gorsoon would come to somethin&rsquo;. Why it was
      wondherful how he used to discoorse upon the chapel-green, yourself and
      himself: but he soon left you behind. And how he sealed up poor ould
      Dixon, the parish dark&rsquo;s mouth, at Barny Boccagh&rsquo;s wake. God rest his
      soul! It was talkin&rsquo; about the Protestant church they wor. &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said
      Misther Denis, &lsquo;you ould termagent, can you tell me who first discovered
      your church?&rsquo; The dotin&rsquo; ould crathur began of hummin&rsquo;, and hawin&rsquo;, and
      advisin&rsquo; the boy to have more sense. &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you ould canticle,
      can you answer? But for fear you can&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll answer for you. It was the
      divil discovered it, one fine mornin&rsquo; that he went out to get an appetite,
      bein&rsquo; in delicate health.&rsquo; Why, Denis, you&rsquo;d tie all that wor present wid
      a rotten sthraw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darby, I ax your pardon over agin for what came between us; and I see now
      betther than I did, that the fault of it was more mine nor yours. You&rsquo;ll
      be down surely about five o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go and take this beard off o&rsquo; me, and clane myself; and I may as
      well do that now: but I&rsquo;ll be down, never fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In throth the boy was always bright!&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&mdash;and he
      sobered Dixon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had him like a judge in no time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he would do it&mdash;he could do that, at all times. God be wid you,
      Darby, till I see you in the evenin&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Bannaght lhath</i>, Denis, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m proud we&rsquo;re as we ought to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      About four o&rsquo;clock, the expected guests began to assemble at Denis&rsquo;s; and
      about the same hour one might perceive Susan O&rsquo;Shaughnessy running out to
      a stile a little above the house, where she stood for a few minutes, with
      her hand shadingher eyes, looking long and intensely towards the direction
      from which she expected her brother to return. Hitherto, however, he could
      not be discovered in the distance, although scarcely five minutes elapsed
      during the intervals of her appearance at the stile to watch him. Some
      horsemen she did notice; but after straining her eyes eagerly and
      anxiously, she was enabled only to report, with a dejected air, that they
      were their own friends coming from a distant part of the parish, to be
      present at the dinner. At length, after a long and eager look, she ran in
      with an exclamation of delight, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank goodness, he&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; at last; I see somebody dressed in black
      ridin&rsquo; down the upper end of Tim Marly&rsquo;s boreen, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m sure an&rsquo; certain
      it must be Denis, from his dress!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll warrant it is, my colleen,&rdquo; replied her father; &ldquo;he said he&rsquo;d be
      here before the dinner would be ready, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s widin a good hour of that.
      I&rsquo;ll thry myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He and his daughter once more went out; but, alas! only to experience a
      fresh disappointment. Instead of Denis, it was Father Finnerty; who, it
      appeared, felt as anxious to be in time for dinner, as the young candidate
      himself could have done. He was advancing at a brisk trot, not upon the
      colt which had been presented to him, but upon his old nag, which seemed
      to feel as eager to get at Denis&rsquo;s oats, as its owner did to taste his
      mutton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, Susy, we&rsquo;ll have a day of it, plase goodness,&rdquo; observed Denis to
      the girl; &ldquo;here&rsquo;s Father Finnerty, and I wouldn&rsquo;t for more nor I&rsquo;ll
      mention that he had staid away: and I hope the coidjuther will come as
      well as himself. Do you go in, aroon, and tell them he&rsquo;s comin&rsquo;, and I&rsquo;ll
      go and meet him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Most of Denis&rsquo;s friends were now assembled, dressed in their best apparel,
      and Raised to the highest pitch of good humor; no man who knows the relish
      with which Irishmen enter into convivial enjoyments, can be ignorant of
      the remarkable flow of spirits which the prospect of an abundant and
      hospitable dinner produces among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Finnerty was one of those priests who constitute a numerous species
      in Ireland; regular, but loose and careless in the observances of his
      church, he could not be taxed with any positive neglect of pastoral duty.
      He held his stations at stated times and places, with great exactness, but
      when the severer duties annexed to them were performed, he relaxed into
      the boon companion, sang his song, told his story, laughed his laugh, and
      occasionally danced his dance, the very <i>beau ideal</i> of a rough,
      shrewd, humorous divine, who, amidst the hilarity of convivial mirth, kept
      an eye to his own interest, and sweetened the severity with which he
      exacted his &ldquo;dues&rdquo; by a manner at once jocose and familiar. If a wealthy
      farmer had a child to christen, his reverence declined baptizing it in the
      chapel, but as a proof of his marked respect for its parents, he and his
      curate did them the honor of performing the ceremony at their own house.
      If a marriage was to be solemnized, provided the parties were wealthy, he
      adopted the same course, and manifested the same flattering marks of his
      particular esteem for the parties, by attending at their residence; or if
      they preferred the pleasure of a journey to his own house, he and his
      curate accompanied them home from the same motives. This condescension,
      whilst it raised the pride of the parties, secured a good dinner and a
      pleasant evening&rsquo;s entertainment for the priests, enhanced their humility
      exceedingly, for the more they enjoyed themselves, the more highly did
      their friends consider themselves honored. This mode of life might, one
      would suppose, lessen their importance and that personal respect which is
      entertained for the priests by the people; but it is not so&mdash;the
      priests can, the moment such scenes are ended, pass, with the greatest
      aptitude of habit, into the hard, gloomy character of men who are replete
      with profound knowledge, exalted piety, and extraordinary power. The
      sullen frown, the angry glance, or the mysterious allusion to the
      omnipotent authority of the church, as vested in their persons, joined to
      some unintelligible dogma, laid down as their authority, are always
      sufficient to check anything derogatory towards them, which is apt to
      originate in the unguarded moments of conviviality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plase your Reverence, I&rsquo;ll put him up myself,&rdquo; said Denis to Father
      Finnerty, as he took his horse by the bridle, and led him towards the
      stable, &ldquo;and how is my cowlt doin&rsquo; wid you, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Troublesome, Denis; he was in a bad state when I got him, and he&rsquo;ll cost
      me nearly his price before I have him thoroughly broke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was pretty well broke wid me, I know,&rdquo; replied Denis, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m afear&rsquo;d
      you&rsquo;ve given him into the hands of some one that knows little about
      horses. Mave,&rdquo; he shouted, passing the kitchen door, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s Father
      Finnerty&mdash;go in, Docthor, and put big Brian Buie out o&rsquo; the corner;
      for goodness sake Exltimnicate him from the hob&mdash;an&rsquo; sure you have
      power to do that any way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest laughed, but immediately assuming a grave face, as he entered,
      exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brian Buie, in the name of the forty-seventh proposition of Euclid&rsquo;s
      Elements&mdash;in the name of the cube and square roots&mdash;of Algebra,
      Mathematics, Fluxions, and the doctrine of all essential spirits that
      admit of proof&mdash;in the name of Nebuchadanezar the divine, who
      invented the convenient scheme of taking a cold collation under a hedge&mdash;by
      the power of that profound branch of learning, the Greek Digemma&mdash;by
      the authority of true Latin, primo, of Beotian Greek, secundo, and of
      Arabian Hebrew, tertio; which is, when united by the skill of profound
      erudition, primo, secundo, tertio; or, being reversed by the logic of
      illustration, <i>tertio, secundo, primo. Commando te in nomine botteli
      potheeni boni drinkandi his oedibus, hac note, inter amicos
      excellentissimi amici mei, Dionissii O&rsquo;Shaughnessy, quem beknavavi ex
      excellentissimo colto ejus, causa pedantissimi filii ejus, designali
      eccleseae, patri, sed nequaquam deo, nec naturae, nec ingenio;&mdash;commando
      te inquam, Bernarde Buie, surgere, stare, ambulare, et decedere e cornero
      isto vel hobbo, qua nunc sedes!</i> Yes, I command thee, Brian Buie, who
      sit upon the hob of my worthy and most excellent friend and parishioner,
      Denis O&rsquo;Shaughnessy, to rise, to stand up before your spiritual superior,
      to walk down from it, and to tremble as if you were about to sink into the
      earth to the neck, but no further; before the fulminations of him who can
      wield the thunder of that mighty Salmoneus, his holiness the Pope,
      successor to St. Peter, who left the servant of the Centurion earless&mdash;I
      command and objurgate thee, sinner as thou art, to vacate your seat on the
      hob for the man of sancity, whose legitimate possession it is, otherwise I
      shall send you, like that worthy archbishop, the aforesaid Nebuchadanezar,
      to live upon leeks for seven years in the renowned kingdom of Wales, where
      the leeks may be seen to this day! Presto!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words, pronounced with a grave face, in a loud, rapid, and sonorous
      tone of voice, startled the good people of the house, who sat mute and
      astonished at such an exordium from the worthy pastor: but no sooner had
      he uttered Brian Buie&rsquo;s name, giving him, at the same time, a fierce and
      authoritative look, than the latter started to his feet, and stepped down
      in a kind of alarm towards the door. The priest immediately placed his
      hand upon his shoulder in a mysterious manner, exclaiming&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed, Brian, I have taken the force of the anathema off you;
      your power to sit or stand, or go where you please, is returned again. I
      wanted your seat, and Denis desired, me to excommunicate you out of it,
      which I did, and you accordingly left it without your own knowledge,
      consent, or power; I transferred you to where you stand, and you had no
      more strength to resist me than if you were an infant not three hours in
      the world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ax God&rsquo;s pardon, an&rsquo; your Reverence&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Brian, in a tremor, &ldquo;if I
      have given offince. Now, bless my soul! what&rsquo;s this? As sure as I stand
      before you, neighbors, I know neither act nor part of how I was brought
      from the hob at all&mdash;neither act nor part! Did any of yez see me
      lavin&rsquo; it; or how did I come here&mdash;can you tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paddy,&rdquo; said one of his friends, &ldquo;did you see him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sorra one o&rsquo; me seen him,&rdquo; replied Paddy: &ldquo;I was lookin&rsquo; at his
      Reverence, sthrivin&rsquo; to know what he was sayin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pether, did you?&rdquo; another inquired. &ldquo;Me! I never seen a stim of him till
      he was standin&rsquo; alone on the flure! Sure, when he didn&rsquo;t see or find
      himself goin&rsquo;, how could another see him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glory be to God!&rdquo; exclaimed Mave; &ldquo;one ought to think well what they say,
      when they spake of the clargy, for they don&rsquo;t know what it may bring down
      upon them, sooner or later!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our Denis will be able to do that yet,&rdquo; said Susan to her elder sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure he will, girsha, as soon as he&rsquo;s ordained&mdash;every bit as
      well as Father Finnerty,&rdquo; replied Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young enthusiast&rsquo;s countenance brightened as her sister spoke: her
      dark eye became for a minute or two fixed upon vacancy, during which it
      flashed several times; until, as the images of her brother&rsquo;s future glory
      passed before her imagination; she became wrapt&mdash;her lip quivered&mdash;her
      cheek flushed into a deeper color, and the tears burst in gushes from her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother, who was now engaged in welcoming Father Finnerty&mdash;a duty
      which the priest&rsquo;s comic miracle prevented her from performing sooner&mdash;did
      not perceive her daughter&rsquo;s agitation, nor, in fact, did any one present
      understand its cause. Whilst the priest was taking Brian Buie&rsquo;s seat, she
      went once more to watch the return of Denis; and while she stood upon the
      stile, her father, after having put up the horse, entered the house, &ldquo;to
      keep his Reverence company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; pray, Docthor,&rdquo; he inquired, &ldquo;where is Father Molony, that he&rsquo;s not
      wid you? I hope he won&rsquo;t disappoint us; he&rsquo;s a mighty pleasant gintleman
      of an evenin&rsquo;, an&rsquo;, barrin&rsquo; your Reverence, I don&rsquo;t know a man tells a
      better story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He entreated permission from me this morning,&rdquo; replied Father Finnerty,
      &ldquo;and that was leave to pay a visit to the Bishop, for what purpose I know
      not, unless to put in a word in season for the first parish that becomes
      vacant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throth, an&rsquo; he well desarves a parish,&rdquo; replied Denis; &ldquo;an&rsquo; although we&rsquo;d
      be loath to part wid him, still we&rsquo;d be proud to hear of his promotion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll meet Denis there,&rdquo; observed Susan, who had returned from the stile:
      &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll be apt to be present at his trial wid the Bishop; an&rsquo; maybe he&rsquo;ll
      be home along wid him. I&rsquo;ll go an&rsquo; thry if I can see them agin;&rdquo; and she
      flew out once more to watch their return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Father Finnerty,&rdquo; said an uncle of Denis&rsquo;s, &ldquo;you can give a good
      guess at what a dacent parish ought to be worth to a parish priest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. O&rsquo;Shaughnessy,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;is that fat brown goose suspended
      before the fire, of your own rearing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed it is, plase your Reverence; but as far as good male an phaties
      could go for the last month, it got the benefit of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray, Mrs. O&rsquo;Shaughnessy, have you many of the same kidney? I only
      ask for information, as I said to Peery Hacket&rsquo;s wife, the last day I held
      the Station in Peery&rsquo;s. There was just such another goose hanging before
      the fire; but, you must know, the cream of the joke was, that I had been
      after coming from the confessional, as hungry as a man could conveniently
      wish himself; and seeing the brown fat goose before the fire just as that
      is, why my teeth, Mave, began to get lachrymose. Upon my Priesthood it was
      such a goose as a priest&rsquo;s corpse might get up on its elbow to look at,
      and exclaim, &lsquo;avourneen machree, it&rsquo;s a thousand pities that I&rsquo;m not
      living to have a cut at you!&rsquo;&mdash;ha, ha, ha! God be good to old Friar
      Hennessy, I have that joke from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, Mrs. Hacket,&rsquo; says I, as I was airing my fingers at the fire, &lsquo;I
      dare say you haven&rsquo;t another goose like this about the house? Now, tell
      me, like an honest woman, have you any of the same kidney?&mdash;I only
      ask for information.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Hacket, however, told me she believed there might be a few of the
      same kind straggling about the place, but said nothing further upon it,
      until the Saturday following, when her son brings me down a pair of the
      fattest geese I ever cut up for my Sunday&rsquo;s dinner. Now, Mrs.
      O&rsquo;Shaughnessy, wasn&rsquo;t that doing the thing dacent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, Docthor,&rdquo; said Denis, &ldquo;that was all right; let Mave alone,
      an&rsquo; maybe she&rsquo;ll be apt to find out a pair that will match Mrs. Hacket&rsquo;s.
      Not that I say it, but she doesn&rsquo;t like to be outdone in anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Docthor, I was wishin&rsquo; to know, sir,&rdquo; continued the uncle of the absent
      candidate, &ldquo;what the value of a good parish might be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, Mave, there&rsquo;s a discrepancy between the goose and the shoulder
      of mutton. The fact is, that if it be a disputation between them, as to
      which will be roasted first, I pronounce that the goose will have it. It&rsquo;s
      now, let me see, half past four o&rsquo;clock, and, in my opinion, it will take
      a full half hour to bring up the mutton. So Mave, if you&rsquo;ll be guided by
      your priest, advance the mutton towards the fire about two inches, and
      keep the little girsha basting steadily, and then you&rsquo;ll be sure to have
      it rich and juicy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Docthor, wid submission, I was wantin&rsquo; to know what a good parish might
      be&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mike Lawdher, if I don&rsquo;t mistake, you ought to have good grazing down in
      your meadows at Ballinard. What will you be charging for a month or two&rsquo;s
      grass for this colt I&rsquo;ve bought from my dacent friend, Denis
      O&rsquo;Shaughnessy, here? And, Mike, be rasonable upon a poor man, for we&rsquo;re
      all poor, being only tolerated by the state we live under, and ought not,
      of course, to be hard upon one another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; what did he cost you, Docthor?&rdquo; replied Mike, answering one question
      by another; &ldquo;what did you get for him, Denis?&rdquo; he continued, referring for
      information to Denis, to whom, on reflection, he thought it more decorous
      to put the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denis, however, felt the peculiar delicacy of his situation, and looked at
      the priest, whilst the latter, under a momentary embarrassment, looked
      significantly at Denis. His Reverence, however, was seldom at a loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you take him to be worth, Mike?&rdquo; he asked; &ldquo;remember he&rsquo;s but
      badly trained, and I&rsquo;m sure it will cost me both money and trouble to make
      anything dacent out of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you got him somewhere between five and twenty and thirty guineas, I
      would say you have good value for your money, plase your Reverence. What
      do you say, Denis&mdash;am I near it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mike, you know as much about a horse as you do about the Pentateuch
      or Paralipomenon. Five and twenty guineas, indeed! I hope you won&rsquo;t set
      your grass as you would sell your horses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, thin, if your Reverence ped ready money for him, I maintain he was
      as well worth twenty guineas as a thief&rsquo;s worth the gallows; an&rsquo; you know,
      sir, I&rsquo;d be long sorry to differ wid you. Am I near it now, Docthor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Denis got for the horse more than that,&rdquo; said his Reverence, &ldquo;and he may
      speak for himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thrue for you, sir,&rdquo; replied Denis; &ldquo;I surely got above twenty guineas
      for him, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m well satisfied wid the bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear that now, Mike&mdash;you hear what he says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no goin&rsquo; beyant it,&rdquo; returned Mike; &ldquo;the proof o&rsquo; the puddin&rsquo; is
      in the atin,&rsquo; as we&rsquo;ll soon know, Mave&mdash;eh, Docthor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never knew Mave to make a bad one,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;except upon the
      day Friar Hennessy dined with me here&mdash;my curate was sick, and I had
      to call in the Friar to assist me at confession; however, to do Mave
      justice, it was not her fault, for the Friar drowned the pudding, which
      was originally a good one, with a deluge of strong whiskey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s too gross,&rsquo; said the facetious Friar, in his loud, strong voice&mdash;&lsquo;it&rsquo;s
      too gross, Docthor Finnerty, so let us spiritualize it, that it may be
      Christian atin, fit for pious men to digest,&rsquo; and then he came out with
      his thundering laugh&mdash;oigh, oigh, oigh, oigh! but he had consequently
      the most of the pudding to himself, an&rsquo; indeed brought the better half of
      it home in his saddle-bags.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix, an&rsquo; he did,&rdquo; said Mave, &ldquo;an&rsquo; a fat goose that he coaxed Mary to
      kill for him unknownst to us all, in the coorse o&rsquo; the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long is he dead, Docthor?&rdquo; said Denis; &ldquo;God rest him any way, he&rsquo;s
      happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He died in the hot summer, now nine years about June last; and talking
      about him, reminds me of a trick he put on me about two years before his
      death. He and I had not been on good terms for long enough before that
      time; but as the curate I had was then sickly, and as I wouldn&rsquo;t be
      allowed two, I found that it might be convenient to call in the Friar
      occasionally, a regulation he did not at all relish, for he said he could
      make far more by questing and poaching about among the old women of the
      parish, with whom he was a great favorite, in consequence of the Latin
      hymns he used to sing for them, and the great cures he used to perform&mdash;a
      species of devotion which neither I nor my curate had time to practise.
      So, in order to renew my intimacy, I sent him a bag of oatmeal and a
      couple of flitches of bacon, both of which he readily accepted, and came
      down to me on the following day to borrow three guineas. After attempting
      to evade him&mdash;for, in fact, I had not the money to spare&mdash;he at
      length succeeded in getting them from me, on the condition that he was to
      give my curate&rsquo;s horse and mine a month&rsquo;s grass, by way of compensation,
      for I knew that to expect payment from him was next to going for piety to
      a parson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I will,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;give your horses the run of my best field&rsquo;&mdash;for
      he held a comfortable bit of ground; &lsquo;but,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;as you have been
      always cutting at me about my principle, I must insist, if it was only to
      convince you of my ginerosity, that you&rsquo;ll lave the choosing of the month
      to myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I really wanted an assistant at the time, in consequence of my
      curate&rsquo;s illness, he had me bound, in some degree, to his own will. I
      accordingly gave him the money; but from that till the day of his death,
      he never sent for our horses, except when there was a foot and a half of
      snow on the ground, at which time he was certain to despatch a messenger
      for him, &lsquo;with Father Hennessy&rsquo;s compliments, and he requested Doctor
      Finnerty to send the horses to Father Hennessy&rsquo;s field, to ate their
      month&rsquo;s grass.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is it true, Docthor, that his face was shinin&rsquo; after his death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True enough, and to my own knowledge, long before that event.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; exclaimed Mave, &ldquo;he was a holy man afther all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly he was,&rdquo; said the priest; &ldquo;there are spots in the sun, Mrs.
      O&rsquo;Shaugh-nessy&mdash;we are not all immaculate. There never was one sent
      into this world without less or more sin upon them. Even the saints
      themselves had venial touches about them, but nothing to signify.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Docthor,&rdquo; said the uncle, pertinaciously adhering to the original
      question, &ldquo;you have an opportunity of knowin&rsquo; what a good parish might be
      worth to a smart, active priest? For the sake of a son of mine that I&rsquo;ve
      some notion of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the by, I wonder Denis is not here before now,&rdquo; exclaimed his
      Reverence, lending a deaf ear to Mike O&rsquo;Shaughnessy&rsquo;s interrogatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Denis&rsquo;s favorite topic had been started, and he accordingly launched
      out upon it with all the delight and ardor of a fond father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Docthor dear, before us all&mdash;an&rsquo; sure you know as well as I do,
      that we&rsquo;re all friends together&mdash;what&rsquo;s your downright opinion of
      Denis? Is he as bright as you tould me the other mornin&rsquo; he was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Denis O&rsquo;Shaughnessy,&rdquo; replied his Reverence, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not pleasant
      to me to be pressed so often to eulogize a young gintleman of whose
      talents I have so frequently expressed my opinion. Is not once sufficient
      for me to say what I&rsquo;ve said concerning him? But, as we are all present, I
      now say and declare, that my opinion of Denis O&rsquo;Shaughnessy, jun., is
      decidedly <i>peculiar</i>&mdash;decidedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, girsha, keep basting the mutton, and never heed my boots&mdash;turn
      it about and baste the back of it better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God be thanked,&rdquo; exclaimed the delighted father, &ldquo;sure it&rsquo;s comfort to
      hear that, any how&mdash;afther all the pains and throuble we&rsquo;ve taken wid
      him, to know it&rsquo;s not lost. Why, that boy was so smart, Docthor, that, may
      I never sin, when he went first to the Latin, but&mdash;an&rsquo; this no lie,
      for I have it from his own lips&mdash;when he&rsquo;d look upon his task two or
      three times over night, he&rsquo;d waken wid every word of it, pat off the book
      the next mornin&rsquo;. And how do you think he got it? Why, the crathur, you
      see, used to dhrame that he was readin&rsquo; it off, and so he used to get it
      that way in his sleep!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Darby Moran, Denis&rsquo;s old foe entered, and his reception was
      cordial, and, if the truth were known, almost magnanimous on the part of
      Denis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darby Moran,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;not a man, barrin&rsquo; his Reverence here, in the
      parish we sit in, that I&rsquo;m prouder to see on my flure&mdash;give me your
      hand, man alive, and Mave and all of ye welcome him. Everything of what
      you know is buried between us, and you&rsquo;re bound to welcome him, if it was
      only in regard of the handsome way he spoke of our son this day&mdash;here&rsquo;s
      my own chair, Darby, and sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throth,&rdquo; said Darby, after shaking hands with the priest and greeting the
      rest of the company, &ldquo;the same boy no one could spake ill of; and,
      although we and his people were not upon the best footin&rsquo;, still the sarra
      one o&rsquo; me but always gave him his due.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I believe you, Darby,&rdquo; said his father; &ldquo;but are you comfortable?
      Draw your chair nearer the fire&mdash;the evenin&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; cowld.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very well, Denis, I thank you;&mdash;nearer the fire! Faix, except
      you want to have me roasted along wid that shoulder of mutton and goose, I
      think I can&rsquo;t go much nearer it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, you wasn&rsquo;t in sooner, Darby, till you&rsquo;d hear what Docthor
      Finnerty here&mdash;God spare him long among us&mdash;said of Denis a
      while ago. Docthor, if it wouldn&rsquo;t be makin&rsquo; too free, maybe you&rsquo;d oblage
      me wid repatin&rsquo; it over again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can never have any hesitation,&rdquo; replied the priest, &ldquo;in repeating
      anything to his advantage&mdash;I stated, Darby, that young Misther
      O&rsquo;Shaughnessy was a youth of whom my opinion was decidedly <i>peculiar</i>&mdash;keep
      basting; child, you&rsquo;re forgetting the goose now; did you never see a
      priest&rsquo;s boots before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; nobody has a better right to know nor yourself, wherever larnin&rsquo; and
      education&rsquo;s consarned,&rdquo; said the father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s not long since I examined him myself; I say it sitting here,
      and I believe every one that hears me is present; and during the course of
      the examination I was really astonished. The translations, and
      derivations, and conjugations, and ratiocinations, and variations, and
      investigations that he gave, were all the most remarkably original I ever
      heard. He would not be contented with the common sense of a passage; but
      he&rsquo;d keep hunting, and hawking, and fishing about for something that was
      out of the ordinary course of reading, that I was truly struck with his
      eccentric turn of genius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think he&rsquo;ll pass the Bishop with great credit, Docthor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I think, Denis&mdash;which is going further than I
      went yet&mdash;I think that if he were the Bishop, and the Bishop the
      candidate for Maynooth, that his lordship would have but a poor chance of
      passing. There&rsquo;s the pinnacle of my eulogium upon him; and now, to give my
      opinion on another important subject; I pronounce both the goose and
      mutton done to a turn. As it appears that Mrs. O&rsquo;Shaughnessy has every
      other portion of the dinner ready, I move that we commence operations as
      soon as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Denis, Docthor? it would be a pleasure to me to have him, poor
      fellow, wid all his throuble over, and his mind at ase; maybe if we wait a
      weeshy while longer, Docthor, that he&rsquo;ll come, and you know Father Molony
      too is to come yet, and some more of our friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the examination was a long one, I tell you that Mr. O&rsquo;Shaughnessy may
      not be here this hour to come; and you may be sure, the Bishop, meeting
      such a bright boy, wouldn&rsquo;t make it a short one. As for Father Molony,
      he&rsquo;ll be here time enough, so I move again that we attack the citadel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, never say it again&mdash;the sarra one o&rsquo; me will keep it
      back, myself bein&rsquo; as ripe as any of you, barrin&rsquo; his Reverence, that
      we&rsquo;re not to take the foreway of in anything. Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whilst Mave and her daughters were engaged in laying dinner, and in making
      all the other arrangements necessary for their comfort, the priest took
      Denis aside, and thus addressed him:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Denis, I need scarcely remark that this meeting of our friends is upon no
      common occasion; that it&rsquo;s neither a wedding, nor a Station, nor a
      christening, but a gathering of relations for a more honorable purpose
      than any of them, excepting the Station, which you know is a religious
      rite. I just mention this privately, lest you might not be properly on
      your guard, and to prevent any appearance of maneness; or&mdash;in short,
      I hope you have abundance of everything; I hope you have, and that, not
      for your own sake so much as for that of your son. Remember your boy, and
      what he&rsquo;s designed for, and don&rsquo;t let the dinner or its concomitants be
      discreditable to him; for, in fact, it&rsquo;s his dinner, observe, and not
      yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thankful, I&rsquo;m deeply thankful, an&rsquo; for ever oblaged to your Reverence
      for your kindness; although, widout at all makin&rsquo; little of it, it wasn&rsquo;t
      wanted here; never fear, Docthor, there&rsquo;ll be lashings and lavins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but make that clear, Denis; here now are near two dozen of us, and
      you say there are more to come, and all the provision I see for them is a
      shoulder of mutton, a goose, and something in that large pot on the fire,
      which I suppose is hung beef.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thrue for you, sir, but you don&rsquo;t know that we&rsquo;ve got a tarin&rsquo; fire down
      in the barn, where there&rsquo;s two geese more and two shouldhers of mutton to
      help what you seen&mdash;not to mintion a great big puddin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; lots of
      other things. Sure you might notice Mave and the girls runnin&rsquo; in an&rsquo; out
      to attind the cookin&rsquo; of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough, Denis, that&rsquo;s sufficient; and now, between you and me, I say your
      son will be the load-star of Maynooth, winch out-tops anything I said of
      him yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a whole keg of whiskey, Docthor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see nothing, to prevent him from being a bishop; indeed, it&rsquo;s almost
      certain, for he can&rsquo;t be kept back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only hope your Reverence will be livin&rsquo; when he praches his first
      sarmon. I have the dam of the coult still, an a wink&rsquo;s as good as a nod,
      please your Reverence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A strong letter in his favor to the President of Maynooth will do him no
      harm,&rdquo; said the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      They then joined their other friends, and in a few minutes an excellent
      dinner, plain and abundant, was spread out upon the table. It consisted of
      the usual materials which constitute an Irish feast in the house of a
      wealthy farmer, whose pride it is to compel every guest to eat so long as
      he can swallow a morsel. There were geese and fowl of all kinds&mdash;shoulders
      of mutton, laughing-potatoes, carrots, parsnips, and cabbage, together
      with an immense pudding, boiled in a clean sheet, and ingeniously kept
      together with long straws* drawn through it in all directions. A lord or
      duke might be senseless enough to look upon such a substantial,
      yeoman-like meal with a sneer; but with all their wealth and elegance,
      perhaps they might envy the health and appetite of those who partook of
      it. When Father Finnerty had given a short grace, and the operations of
      the table were commenced,&mdash;Denis looked around him with a
      disappointed air, and exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father Finnerty, there&rsquo;s only one thing, indeed I may say two, a wantin&rsquo; 
      to complate our happiness&mdash;I mean Denis and Father Molony! What on
      earth does your Reverence think can keep them?&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * This, about thirty years ago, was usual at weddings
     and other feasts, where everything went upon a large
     scale.
</pre>
    <p>
      To this he received not a syllable of reply, nor did he consider it
      necessary to urge the question any further at present. Father Finnerty&rsquo;s
      powers of conversation seemed to have abandoned him; for, although there
      were some few expressions loosely dropped, yet the worthy priest
      maintained an obstinate silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, in due time, he began to let fall an occasional remark, impeded
      considerably by hiccups, and an odd <i>Deo Gratias</i>, or <i>Laus Deo</i>,
      uttered in that indecisive manner which indicates the position of a man
      who debates within himself whether he ought to rest satisfied or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the tramping of a horse was heard approaching the door, and
      immediately every one of Denis&rsquo;s family ran out to ascertain whether it
      was the young candidate. Loud and clamorous was their joy on finding that
      they were not mistaken; he was alone, and, on arriving at the door,
      dismounted slowly, and received their welcomes and congratulations with a
      philosophy which perplexed them not a little. The scene of confusion which
      followed his entrance into the house could scarcely be conceived: every
      hand was thrust out to welcome him, and every tongue loud in wishing him
      joy and happiness. The chairs and stools were overturned as they stood in
      the way of those who wished to approach him; plates fell in the bustle,
      and wooden trenchers trundled along the ground; the dogs, on mingling with
      the crowd that surrounded him, were kicked angrily from among them by
      those who had not yet got shaking hands with Denis. Father Finnerty,
      during this commotion, kept his seat in the most dignified manner; but the
      moment it had subsided he stretched out his hand to Denis, exclaiming:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. O&rsquo;Shaughnessy, I congratulate you upon the event of this auspicious
      day! I wish you joy and happiness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do we all, over and over agin!&rdquo; they exclaimed; &ldquo;a proud gintleman he
      may be this night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, Father Finnerty,&rdquo; said Denis, &ldquo;and I thank you all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Denis, avourneen,&rdquo; said his mother, &ldquo;sit down an&rsquo; ate a hearty dinner;
      you must be both tired and hungry, so sit down, avick, and when you&rsquo;re
      done you can tell us all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Bonum concilium, mi chare Dionysi</i>&mdash;the advice is good, Mrs.
      O&rsquo;Shaughnessy, and I myself will, in honor of this day, although I have
      already dined, just take another slice;&rdquo; and as he spoke he helped
      himself. &ldquo;Anything to honor a friend,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;but, by the by,
      before I commence, I will try your own prescription, Denis&mdash;a whetter
      of this poteen at intervals. Hoch, that&rsquo;s glorious stuff&mdash;pure as any
      one of the cardinal virtues, and strong as fortitude, which is the
      champion of them all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis, during these pleasant observations of the priest, sat silent, with
      a countenance pale and apparently dejected. When his mother had filled his
      plate, he gently put it away from him; but poured out a little spirits and
      water, which he drank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot eat a morsel,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;mother, don&rsquo;t press me, it&rsquo;s
      impossible. We are all assembled here&mdash;friends, neighbors, and
      relations&mdash;I&rsquo;ll not disguise the fact&mdash;but the truth is, I have
      been badly treated this day; I have been, in the most barefaced manner,
      rejected by the Bishop, and a nephew of Father Molony&rsquo;s elected in my
      place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The effect which this disclosure produced upon the company present,
      especially upon his own family, utterly defies description. His father
      hastily laid down his glass, and his eyes opened to the utmost stretch of
      their lids; his mother let a plate fall which she was in the act of
      handing to one of her daughters, who was about to help a poor beggar at
      the door; all convivial enjoyment was suspended; the priest laid down his
      knife and fork, and fixed his large eyes upon Denis, with his mouth full;
      his young sister, Susan, flew over to his side, and looked intensely into
      his countenance for an explanation of what he meant, for she had not
      properly understood him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rejected!&rdquo; exclaimed the priest&mdash;&ldquo;rejected! Young man, I am your
      spiritual superior, and I command you, on this occasion, to practise no
      jocularity whatsoever&mdash;I lay it upon you as a religious duty to be
      serious and candid, to speak truth, and inform us at once whether what you
      have advanced be true or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; said Denis, &ldquo;that it was only jocularity on my part; but I
      solemnly assure you all that it is not. The Bishop told me that I suffered
      myself to be misled as to my qualifications for entrance; he says it will
      take a year and a half&rsquo;s hard study to enable me to matriculate with a
      good grace. I told him that your Reverence examined me, and said I was
      well prepared; and he said to me, in reply, that your Reverence was very
      little of a judge as to my fitness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;I thank his lordship; &lsquo;tis true, I deserved
      that from him; but it can&rsquo;t be helped. I see, at all events, how the land
      lies. Denis O&rsquo;Shaughnessy, I pronounce you to be, in the first place, an
      extremely stultified and indiscreet young man; and, in the next place, as
      badly treated and as oppressed a candidate for Maynooth as entered it. I
      pronounce you, in the face of the world, right well prepared for it; but I
      see now who is the spy of the diocese&mdash;oh, oh, thank you, Misther
      Molony&mdash;I now remimber, that he is related to his lordship through
      the beggarly clan of the M&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s. But wait a little; if I have
      failed here, thank Heaven I have interest in the next diocese, the Bishop
      of which is my cousin, and we will yet have a tug for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mother and sisters of Denis were now drowned in tears; and the grief
      of his sister Susan was absolutely hysterical. Old Denis&rsquo;s brow became
      pale and sorrowful, his eye sunk, and his hand trembled. His friends all
      partook of this serious disappointment, and sat in silence and
      embarrassment around the table. Young Denis&rsquo;s distress was truly intense:
      he could not eat a morsel; his voice was tremulous with vexation; and,
      indeed, altogether the aspect of those present betokened the occurrence of
      some grievous affliction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Brian, Denis&rsquo;s elder brother, &ldquo;I only say this, that it&rsquo;s a
      good story for him to tell that he is a Bishop, otherwise I&rsquo;d think no
      more of puttin&rsquo; a bullet through him from behind a hedge, than I would of
      shootin&rsquo; a cur dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that, Brian,&rdquo; said his mother; &ldquo;bad as it is, he&rsquo;s one of our
      clargy, so don&rsquo;t spake disrespectful of him; sure a year is not much to
      wait, an&rsquo; the next time you go before him it won&rsquo;t be in his power to keep
      you back. As for Father Molony, we wish, him well, but undher the roof of
      this house, except at a Station, or something else of the kind, he will
      never sit, barrin&rsquo; I thought it was either dhry or hungry, that I wouldn&rsquo;t
      bring evil upon my substance by refusin&rsquo; him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that was his lordship&rsquo;s character of me?&rdquo; inquired the priest once
      more with chagrin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that was not, perhaps you will find it in this letter,&rdquo; replied Denis,
      handing him a written communication from the Bishop. Father Finnerty
      hastily broke open the seal, and read silently as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>To the Rev. Father Finnerty, peace, and benediction.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rev. Sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel deep indignation at hearing the disclosure made to me this day by
      the bearer, touching your negotiation with him and his family, concerning
      a horse, as the value paid by them to you for procuring the use of my
      influence in his favor; and I cannot sufficiently reprobate such a
      transaction, nor find terms strong enough in which to condemn the parties
      concerned in it. Sir, I repeat it, that such juggling is more
      reprehensible on your part than on theirs, and that it is doubly
      disrespectful to me, to suppose that I could be influenced by anything but
      merit in the candidates. I desire you will wait upon me to-morrow, when I
      hope you may be able to place the transaction in such a light as will
      raise you once more to the estimation in which I have always held you.
      There are three other candidates, one of whom is a relation of your
      excellent curate&rsquo;s; but I have as yet made no decision, so that the
      appointment is still open. In the meantime, I command you to send back the
      horse to his proper owner, as soon after the receipt of this as possible,
      for O&rsquo;Shaughnessy must not be shackled by any such stipulations. I have
      now to ask your Christian forgiveness, for having, under the influence of
      temporary anger, spoken of you before this lad with disrespect. I hereby
      make restitution, and beg that you will forgive me, and remember me by
      name in your prayers, as I shall also name you in mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, etc.,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;+ James M.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Father Finnerty read this letter, his countenance gradually assumed
      an expression of the most irresistible humor; nothing could be more truly
      comic than the significant look he directed toward each individual of the
      O&rsquo;Shaughnessys, not omitting even the little boy who had basted the goose,
      whom he patted on the head with that mechanical abstraction resulting from
      the occurrence of something highly agreeable. The cast of his features was
      now the more ludicrous, when contrasted with the rueful visage he
      presented on hearing the manner in which his character had been delineated
      by the Bishop. At length he laid himself back in his chair, and putting
      his hands to his sides, fairly laughed out loudly for near five minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;Dionysius, Dionysius, but you are the simple and
      unsophisticated youth! Oh, you <i>bocaun</i> of the wide earth, to come
      home with a long face upon you, telling us that you were rejected, and you
      not rejected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not rejected!&mdash;not rejecet!&mdash;not rejeckset!&mdash;not
      raxjaxet!&rdquo; they all exclaimed, attempting to pronounce the word as well as
      they could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the sake of heaven above us, Docthor, don&rsquo;t keep us in doubt one
      minute longer,&rdquo; said old Denis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; said the priest, becoming instantly grave, &ldquo;follow me,
      Dionysius; follow me Denis More, and Brian, all follow&mdash;follow me. I
      have news for you! My friends, we&rsquo;ll be back instantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They accordingly passed into another room, where they remained in close
      conference for about a quarter of an hour, after which they re-entered in
      the highest spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Denis, &ldquo;Pether, go over, <i>abouchal</i>, to Andy Bradagh&rsquo;s
      for Larry Cassidy the piper&mdash;fly like a swallow, Pether, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t
      come without him. Mave, achora, all&rsquo;s right. Susy, you darlin&rsquo;, dhry your
      eyes, avourneen, all&rsquo;s right. Nabors, friends&mdash;fill, fill&mdash;I say
      all&rsquo;s right still. My son&rsquo;s not disgraced, nor he won&rsquo;t be disgraced
      whilst I have a house over my head, or a beast in my stable. Docthor,
      reverend Docthor, drink; may I never sin, but you must get merry an&rsquo; dance
      a &lsquo;cut-along&rsquo; wid myself, when the music comes, and you must thrip the
      priest in his boots wid Susy here afther. Excuse me, nabors&mdash;Docthor,
      you won&rsquo;t blame me, there&rsquo;s both joy and sorrow in these tears. I have had
      a good family of childhre, an&rsquo; a faithful wife; an&rsquo; Mave, achora, although
      time has laid his mark upon you as well as upon myself, and the locks are
      gray that wor once as black as a raven: yet, Mave, I seen the day, an&rsquo; 
      there&rsquo;s many livin&rsquo; to prove it&mdash;ay, Mave, I seen the day when you
      wor worth lookin&rsquo; at&mdash;the wild rose of Lisbuie she was called,
      Docthor. Well, Mave, I hope that my eyes may be closed by the hands I
      loved an&rsquo; love so well&mdash;an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s your own, <i>agrab machree</i>,
      an&rsquo; Denis&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whisht, Denis asthore,&rdquo; said Mave, wiping her eyes, &ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;ll never
      see that day. Afther seein&rsquo; Denis here, what we all hope him to be, the
      next thing I wish is, that I may never live to see my husband taken away
      from me, acushla; no, I hope God will take me to himself before that
      comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There is something touching in the burst of pathetic affection which
      springs strongly from the heart of a worthy couple, when, seated among
      their own family, the feelings of the husband and father, the wife and
      mother, overpower them. In this case, the feeling is always deep in
      proportion to the strength and purity of domestic affection; still it is
      checked by the melancholy satisfaction that our place is to be filled by
      those who are dear to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;that the scent lies still warm, let me ask
      you, Dionysius, how the Bishop came to understand the compactum?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really cannot undertake to say,&rdquo; replied Denis; &ldquo;but if any man has an
      eye like a <i>basileus</i> he has. On finding, sir, that there was some
      defect in my responsive powers, he looked keenly at me, closing his
      piercing-eyes a little, and inquired upon what ground I had presented
      myself as a candidate. I would have sunk the compactum altogether, but for
      the eye. I suspended and hesitated a little, and at length told him that
      there was an understanding&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;kind of&mdash;in short,
      he squeezed the whole secret out o&rsquo; me gradationally. You know the
      result!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Dionysius, you are yet an unfledged bird; but it matters little. All
      will be rectified soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, Dinis,&rdquo; inquired his mother, &ldquo;was it only takin&rsquo; a rise out of us
      you wor all the time? Throth, myself&rsquo;s not the betther of the fright you
      put me into.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Denis, &ldquo;the Bishop treated me harshly, I thought: he said I
      was not properly fit. &lsquo;You might pass,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;upon a particular
      occasion, or under peculiar circumstances; but it will take at least a
      year and a half&rsquo;s study to enable you to enter Maynooth as I would wish
      you. You may go home again,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;at present I have dismissed the
      subject.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After this, on meeting Father Molony, he told me that his cousin had
      passed, and that he would be soon sent up to Maynooth: so I concluded all
      hope was over with me; but I didn&rsquo;t then know what the letter to Father
      Finnerty contained. I now see that I may succeed still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may and shall, Denis; but no thanks to Father Molony for that:
      however, I shall keep my eye upon the same curate, never fear. Well, let
      that pass, and now for harmony, conviviality, and friendship. Gentlemen,
      fill your glasses&mdash;I mean your respective vessels. Come, Denis More,
      let that porringer of yours be a brimmer. Ned Hanratty, charge your
      noggin. Darby, although your mug wants an ear, it can hold the full of it.
      Mrs. O&rsquo;Shaughnessy, that old family cruiskeen ought to be with your
      husband: but no matther&mdash;<i>non constat</i>&mdash;Eh? Dionysi?
      Intelligible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Intelligo, domine</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here then is health, success, and prosperity to Mr. Dionysius
      O&rsquo;Shaughnessy, jun.! May he soon be on the Retreat in the vivacious walls
      of that learned and sprightly seminary, Maynooth! * On the Retreat, I say,
      getting fat upon half a meal a day for the first week, fasting tightly
      against the grain, praying sincerely for a settin&rsquo; at the king&rsquo;s mutton,
      and repenting thoroughly of his penitence!&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * This is a passage which I fear few general readers
     will understand without explanation; the meaning is
     this:&mdash;When a young-man first enters Maynooth College
     he devotes himself for the space of eight days to
     fasting and prayer, separating himself as much as
     possible from all society. He must review his whole
     life, and ascertain, it he can, whether he has ever
     left any sin of importance unconfessed, either
     knowingly or by an emission that was culpably
     negligent. After this examination, which must be both
     severe and strict, he makes what is called a General
     Confession; that is, he confesses all the sins he ever
     committed as far back and as accurately as he can
     recollect them. This being over, he enters upon his
     allotted duties as a student and in good sooth feels
     himself in admirable trim for &ldquo;a set-in at the King&rsquo;s
     Mutton.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Docthor, that is a toast. Denis, have you nothing to say to that?
      Won&rsquo;t you stand up an&rsquo; thank his Reverence, anyhow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am really too much oppressed with relaxation,&rdquo; said Denis, &ldquo;to return
      thanks in that florid style which would become my pretensions. I cannot,
      however, but thank Father Finnerty for his ingenious and learned toast,
      which does equal honor to his head and heart, and I might superadd, to his
      intellects also; for in drinking toasts, my friends, I always elaborate a
      distinction between strength of head and strength of intellect. I now
      thank you all for having in so liberal a manner drunk my health; and in
      grateful return, I request you will once more fill your utensils, and
      learnedly drink&mdash;long life and a mitre to the Reverend Father
      Finnerty, of the Society of St. Dominick, Doctor of Divinity and Parochial
      Priest of this excellent parish!&mdash;<i>Propino tibi salutem, Doctor
      doctissime, reverendissime, et sanctissime; nec non omnibus amicis hic
      congregatis!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest&rsquo;s eye, during this speech, twinkled with humor; he saw clearly
      that Denis thoroughly understood the raillery of his toast, and that the
      compliment was well repaid. On this subject he did not wish, however, to
      proceed further, and his object now was, that the evening should pass off
      as agreeably as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning Father Finnerty paid Denis a timely visit, having first, as
      he had been directed, sent home the colt a little after day-break. They
      then took an early breakfast, and after about half an hour&rsquo;s further
      deliberation, the priest, old Denis, and his son&mdash;the last mounted
      upon the redoubtable colt&mdash;proceeded to the Bishop&rsquo;s residence. His
      lordship had nearly finished breakfast, which he took in his study; but as
      he was engaged with his brother, the barrister, who slept at his house the
      night before, in order to attend a public meeting on that day, he could
      not be seen for some time after they arrived. At length they were
      admitted. The Right Reverend Doctor was still seated at the breakfast
      table, dressed in a morning-gown of fine black stuff, such as the brothers
      of the Franciscan order of monks usually wear, to which order he belonged.
      He wore black silk stockings, gold knee-buckles to his small-clothes, a
      rich ruby ring upon his finger, and a small gold cross, net with
      brilliants, about his neck. This last was not usually visible; but as he
      had not yet dressed for the day, it hung over his vest. He sat, or rather
      lolled back in a stuffed easy chair, one leg thrown indolently over the
      other. Though not an old man, he wore powder, which gave him an air of
      greater reverence; and as his features were sharp and intelligent, his eye
      small but keen, and his manner altogether impressive and gentlemanly, if
      not dignified, it was not surprising that Father Finnerty&rsquo;s two companions
      felt awed and embarrassed before him. Nor was the priest himself wholly
      free from that humbling sensation which one naturally feels when in the
      presence of a superior mind in a superior station of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning to your lordship!&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;I am exceedingly happy
      to see you look so well. Counsellor, your most obedient; I hope, sir, you
      are in good health!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this both gentlemen replied in the usual commonplace terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; continued the priest, &ldquo;this is a worthy dacent parishioner of
      mine, Denis O&rsquo;Shaughnessy; and this is his son who has the honor to be
      already known to your lordship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, O&rsquo;Shaughnessy,&rdquo; said the Bishop, &ldquo;take a seat, young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I humbly thank your lordship,&rdquo; replied Denis the elder, taking a chair as
      he spoke, and laying his hat beside him on the carpet. The son, who
      trembled at the moment from head to foot, did not sit as he was asked, but
      the father, after giving him a pluck, said in a whisper, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you sit,
      when his lordship-bids you.&rdquo; He then took a seat, but appeared scarcely to
      know whether he sat or stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the by, Doctor, you have improved this place mightily,&rdquo; continued
      Father Finnerty, &ldquo;since I had the pleasure of being here last. I thought I
      saw a green-house peeping over the garden-wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the Bishop, &ldquo;I am just beginning to make a collection of
      shrubs and flowers upon a small scale. I believe you are aware that
      tending and rearing flowers, Mr. Finnerty, is a favorite amusement with
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I have a good right to know as much, Dr. M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo;
       replied Mr. Finnerty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t mistake, I sent you some specimens for your garden that were
      not contemptible. And if I don&rsquo;t mistake again, I shall be able to send
      your lordship a shrub that would take the pearl off a man&rsquo;s eye only to
      look at it. And what&rsquo;s more, it&rsquo;s quite a new-comer; not two years in the
      country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray how is it called, Mr. Finnerty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my credit, Doctor, with great respect, I will tell you nothing more
      about it at present. If you wish to see it, or to know its name, or to get
      a slip of it, you must first come and eat a dinner with me. And,
      Counsellor, if you, too, could appear on your own behalf, so much the
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear I cannot, Mr. Finnerty, but I dare say my brother will do himself
      the pleasure of dining with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It cannot be for at least six weeks, Mr. Finnerty,&rdquo; said the Bishop. &ldquo;You
      forget that the confirmations begin in ten days; but I shall have the
      pleasure of dining with you when I come to confirm in your parish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phoo! Why, Doctor, that&rsquo;s a matter of course. Couldn&rsquo;t your lordship make
      it convenient to come during the week, and bring the Counsellor here with
      you? Don&rsquo;t say no, Counsellor; I&rsquo;ll have no demurring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Finnerty,&rdquo; said the Bishop, &ldquo;it is impossible at present. My brother
      goes to Dublin to-morrow, and I must go on the following day to attend the
      consecration of a chapel in the metropolis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then upon my credit, your lordship will get neither the name nor
      description of my Facia, until you earn it by eating a dinner, and
      drinking a glass of claret with the Rev. Father Finnerty. Are those hard
      terms, Counsellor?&mdash;Ha! ha! ha! I&rsquo;m not the man to put off a thing, I
      assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Finnerty,&rdquo; said the Bishop, smiling at, but not noticing the worthy
      priest&rsquo;s blunder about the Fucia, &ldquo;if possible, I shall dine with you
      soon; but at present it is out of my power to appoint a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, Doctor, make your own time of it; and now for the purport of
      our journey. Denis O&rsquo;Shaughnessy here, my lord, is a warm, respectable
      parishioner of mine&mdash;a man indeed for whom I have a great regard. He
      is reported to have inherited from his worthy father, two horns filled
      with guineas. His grandmother, as he could well inform your lordship, was
      born with a lucky caul upon her, which caul is still in the family. Isn&rsquo;t
      it so, Denis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, in dignity, it&rsquo;s truth,&rdquo; replied Denis, &ldquo;and from the time it
      came into the family they always thruv, thanks be to goodness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer sat eyeing the priest and Denis alternately, evidently puzzled
      to comprehend what such a remarkable introduction could lead to.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop seemed not to be surprised, for his features betrayed no change
      whatsoever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having, therefore, had the necessary means of educating a son for the
      church, he has accordingly prepared this young man with much anxiety and
      expense for Maynooth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plase your lordship,&rdquo; said Denis, &ldquo;Docthor Finnerty is clothin&rsquo; it
      betther than I could do. My heart is fixed upon seein&rsquo; him what we all
      expect him to be, your lordship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Finnerty,&rdquo; observed the Bishop, &ldquo;you seem to be intimately acquainted
      with O&rsquo;Shaughnessy&rsquo;s circumstances; you appear to take a warm interest in
      the family, particularly in the success of his son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly my lord; I am particularly anxious for his success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You received my letter yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am here to-day, my lord, in consequence of having received it. But, by
      the by, there was, under favor, a slight misconception on the part of your&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What misconception, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, my lord&mdash;Counsellor, this is a&mdash;a&mdash;kind of charge his
      lordship is bringing against me, under a slight misconception. My lord,
      the fact is, that I didn&rsquo;t see what ecclesiastical right I had to prevent
      Denis here from disposing of his own property to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect an apology from you, Mr. Finnerty, but neither a defence nor a
      justification. An attempt at either will not advance the interests of your
      young friend, believe me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I have only to say that the wish expressed in your lordship&rsquo;s letter
      has been complied with. But wait awhile, my lord,&rdquo; continued the priest,
      good-humoredly, &ldquo;I shall soon turn the tables on yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that, pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, my lord, the horse is in your stable, and Denis declares he will not
      take him out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not the slightest objection to that,&rdquo; replied the Bishop, &ldquo;upon
      the express condition that his son shall never enter Maynooth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; observed Mr. Finnerty, &ldquo;I leave the matter now between your
      lordship and O&rsquo;Shaughnessy himself. You may act as you please, Doctor, and
      so may he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Finnerty, if I could suppose for a moment that the suggestion of thus
      influencing me originated with you, I would instantly deprive you of your
      parish, and make you assistant to your excellent curate, for whom I
      entertain a sincere regard. I have already expressed my opinion of the
      transaction alluded to in my letter. You have frequently offended me, Mr.
      Finnerty, by presuming too far upon my good temper, and by relying
      probably upon your own jocular disposition. Take care, sir, that you don&rsquo;t
      break down in some of your best jokes. I fear that under the guise of
      humor, you frequently avail yourself of the weakness, or ignorance, or
      simplicity of your parishioners. I hope, Mr. Finnerty, that while you
      laugh at the jest, they don&rsquo;t pay for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest here caught the Counsellor&rsquo;s eye, and gave him a dry wink, not
      unperceived, however, by the Bishop, who could scarcely repress a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have known me better, Mr. Finnerty, than to suppose that any
      motive could influence me in deciding upon the claims of candidates for
      Maynooth, besides their own moral character and literary acquirements. So
      long as I live, this, and this alone, shall be the rule of my conduct,
      touching persons in the circumstances of young O&rsquo;Shaughnessy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My gracious lord,&rdquo; said Denis, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be angry wid Mr. Finnerty. I&rsquo;ll
      bear it all, for it was my fau&rsquo;t. The horse is mine, and say what you
      will, out of your stable I&rsquo;ll never bring him. I think, wid great
      sibmission a man may do what he pleases wid his own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the Bishop; &ldquo;my consent to permit your son to goto
      Maynooth is my own. Now this consent I will not give if you press that
      mode of argument upon me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Reverend Lord, as heaven&rsquo;s above me, I&rsquo;d give all I&rsquo;m worth to see the
      boy in Maynooth. If he doesn&rsquo;t go afther all our hopes, I&rsquo;d break my
      heart.&rdquo; He was so deeply affected that the large tears rolled down his
      cheeks as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will your Lordship buy the horse?&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want him, and you,
      maybe, do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not want him,&rdquo; said the Bishop, &ldquo;and if I did, I would not, under
      the present circumstances, purchase him from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then my boy won&rsquo;t get in, your lordship. And you&rsquo;ll neither buy the
      horse, nor take him as a present. My curse upon him for a horse! The first
      thing I&rsquo;ll do when I get home will be to put a bullet through him, for he
      has been an unlucky thief to us. Is my son aquil to the others, that came
      to pass your lordship?&rdquo; asked Denis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is none of them properly qualified,&rdquo; said the Bishop. &ldquo;If there be
      any superiority among them your son has it. He is not without natural
      talent, Mr. Finnerty; his translations are strong and fluent, but
      ridiculously pedantic. That, however, is perhaps less his fault than the
      fault of those who instructed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you anxious to dispose of the horse?&rdquo; said the Counsellor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A single day, sir, he&rsquo;ll never pass in my stable,&rdquo; said Denis; &ldquo;he has
      been an unlucky baste to me an&rsquo; mine, an&rsquo; to all that had anything to do
      wid him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray what age is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Risin&rsquo; four, sir; &lsquo;deed I believe he&rsquo;s four all out, an&rsquo; a purty devil&rsquo;s
      clip he is, as you&rsquo;d wish to see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said the Counsellor, rising, &ldquo;let us have a look at him. Mr.
      Finnerty, you&rsquo;re an excellent judge; will you favor me with your opinion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest and he, accompanied by the two O&rsquo;Shaughnessys, passed out to
      the stable yard, where their horses stood. As they went, Father Finnerty
      whispered to O&rsquo;Shaughnessy:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Denis, is your time. Strike while the iron is hot. Don&rsquo;t take a
      penny!&mdash;don&rsquo;t take a fraction! Get into a passion, and swear you&rsquo;ll
      shoot him unless he accepts him as a present. If he does, all&rsquo;s right; he
      can twine the Bishop round his finger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, sir,&rdquo; said Denis; &ldquo;I see! Let me alone for managin&rsquo; him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The barrister was already engaged in examining the horse&rsquo;s mouth, as is
      usual, when the priest accosted him with&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are transgressing etiquette in this instance, Counsellor. You know
      the proverb&mdash;never look a gift horse in the mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, Mr. Finnerty?&mdash;a gift horse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Reverence is right!&rdquo; exclaimed Denis: &ldquo;the sorra penny ever will
      cross my pocket for the same horse. You must take him as he stands, sir,
      barrin&rsquo; the bridle an&rsquo; saddle, that&rsquo;s not my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will take no money,&rdquo; said the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, my dear sir! Why not take a fair price for him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divil the penny will cross my pocket for him, the unlucky thief!&rdquo; replied
      the shrewd farmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then in that case the negotiation is ended,&rdquo; replied the barrister. &ldquo;I
      certainly will not accept him as a present. Why should I? What claim have
      I on Mr. O&rsquo;Shaughnessy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to take him,&rdquo; said Denis; &ldquo;I want nobody to take him:
      but I know the dogs of the parish &lsquo;ll be pickin&rsquo; his bones afore night.
      You may as well have him, sir, as not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the man serious, Mr. Finnerty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw a man in my life having a more serious appearance, I assure
      you,&rdquo; said the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, it&rsquo;s a queer business,&rdquo; replied the other: &ldquo;a most extraordinary
      affair as I ever witnessed! Why, it would be madness to destroy such a
      fine animal as that! The horse is an excellent one! However, I shall
      certainly not accept him, until I ascertain whether I can prevail upon the
      bishop to elect his son to this vacancy. If I can make the man no return
      for him, I shall let him go to the dogs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go up and set to work,&rdquo; said the priest; &ldquo;but remember that <i>tace</i>
      is Latin for a candle. Keep his lordship in the dark, otherwise this scion
      is ousted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;In the meantime bring them into the parlor until
      I try what can be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the Bishop upon the father&rsquo;s affection for him,&rdquo; said the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right. I am glad you mentioned it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor man will break his heart,&rdquo; said the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will,&rdquo; responded the Counsellor smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So will the mother, too,&rdquo; said the priest, with an arch look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the whole family,&rdquo; replied the Counsellor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go up instantly,&rdquo; said the priest; &ldquo;you have often got a worse fee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, perhaps, with less prospect of success,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Gentlemen,
      have the goodness to walk into the parlor for a few minutes, while I
      endeavor to soften my brother a little, if I can, upon this untoward
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the priest and his two friends entered the parlor, which was
      elegantly furnished, they stood for a moment to survey it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Denis, however, was too much engaged in the subject which lay nearest
      his heart to take pleasure in anything else; at least until he should hear
      the priest&rsquo;s opinion upon the posture of affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does your reverence think?&rdquo; said Denis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behave yourself,&rdquo; replied the pastor. &ldquo;None of your nonsense! You know
      what I think as well as I do myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But will Dionnisis pass?&mdash;Will he go to Maynooth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you go to your dinner to-day, or to your bed to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God be praised! Well, Docthor, wait till we see him off, then I&rsquo;ll be
      spakin&rsquo; to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the priest; &ldquo;but wait till you tike a toss upon this sofa, and
      then you will get a taste of ecclesiastical luxury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Denis, &ldquo;but would it be right o&rsquo; me to sit in it? Maybe it&rsquo;s
      consecrated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, you may swear that; but it is to the ease and comfort of his
      lordship! Come, man, sit down, till you see how you&rsquo;ll sink in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, murdher!&rdquo; exclaimed Denis, &ldquo;where am I at all? Docthor dear, am I in
      sight? Do you see the crown o&rsquo; my head, good or bad? Oh, may I never sin,
      but that&rsquo;s great state!&mdash;Well, to be sure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;see what it is to be a bishop in any church! The
      moment a man becomes a bishop, he fastens tooth and nail upon luxury, as
      if a mitre was a dispensation for enjoying the world that they have sworn
      to renounce. Dionysius, look about you! Isn&rsquo;t this worth studying for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the hitherto silent candidate, &ldquo;if it was perusal on the
      part of his lordship that got it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my credit, a shrewd observation! Ah, Dionysius, merit is overlooked
      in every church, and in every profession; or perhaps&mdash;hem!&mdash;ehem!&mdash;perhaps
      some of your reverend friends might be higher up! I mean nobody; but if
      sound learning, and wit, and humor, together with several other virtues
      which I decline enumerating, could secure a mitre, why mitres might be on
      other brows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is surely great state,&rdquo; observed the candidate; &ldquo;and if it be a
      thing that I matriculate&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said the priest, interrupting him, &ldquo;this same bishop&mdash;who
      is, no doubt, a worthy man, but who has no natural ear for a jest&mdash;was
      once upon a time the priest of an indifferent good parish, like myself;
      ay, and a poor, cowardly, culprit-looking candidate, ready to sink into
      the earth, before his bishop, like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me cowardly!&rdquo; said the candidate: &ldquo;I decline the insinuation altogether.
      It was nothing but veneration and respect, which you know we should
      entertain for all our spiritual superiors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s truth decidedly; though, at the same time, your nerves were
      certainly rather entangled, like a ravelled hank. But no matter, man; we
      have all felt the same in our time. Did you observe how I managed the
      bishop?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I did,&rdquo; replied the candidate, who felt hurt at the
      imputation of cowardice before his father; &ldquo;but I saw, sir, that the
      bishop managed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray for a longer vision, Dionysius. I tell you that no other priest in
      the diocese could have got both you and me out of the dilemma in which we
      stood but myself. He has taken to the study of weeds and plants in his old
      days; and I, who have a natural taste for botany, know it is his weak
      side. I tell you, he would give the right of filling a vacancy in
      Maynooth, any day in the year, for a rare plant or flower. So much for
      your knowledge of human nature. You&rsquo;ll grant I managed the Counsellor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between my father and you, sir, things look well. We have not, however,
      got a certificate of success yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Patientia fit levior ferendo!</i>&mdash;Have patience, man. Wait till
      we see the Counsellor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had scarcely uttered the last words when that gentleman entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Counsellor,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;is it a hit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray what is your Christian name, Mr. O&rsquo;Shaughnessy?&rdquo; inquired the lawyer
      o! young Denis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Christian name, sir,&rdquo; replied Denis, &ldquo;is Di-o-ny-si-us O&rsquo;Shaughnessy.
      That, sir, is the name by which I am always appellated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite sufficient,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;I shall be with you again in a
      few minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But won&rsquo;t you give us a hint, my good sir, as to how the land lies?&rdquo; said
      the priest, as the lawyer left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presently, Mr. Finnerty, presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Intelligisme, Dionisi?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vix, Domine. Quid sentis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quid sentis! No, but it was good fortune sent us. Don&rsquo;t you persave,
      Dionysius, and you, Denis&mdash;don&rsquo;t you know, I say, that this letter of
      admission couldn&rsquo;t be written except the bishop knew his name in full?
      Unlucky! Faith if ever a horse was lucky this is he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare, Docthor,&rdquo; said the father, &ldquo;I can neither sit nor stand, nor
      think of any one thing for a minute, I&rsquo;m so much on the fidgets to know
      what the Bishop &lsquo;ill say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I also,&rdquo; said Dionysius, &ldquo;am in state of evaporation and uncertainty
      touching the same point. However, this I can affirm with veracity, that if
      I am rejected, my mind is made up to pursue an antithetical course of life
      altogether. If he rejects me now, he will never reject me again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Musha, how&mdash;Denny&mdash;Dionysis, avick? What do you mane?&rdquo; said the
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will give,&rdquo; said the son, &ldquo;what is designated a loose translation of my
      meaning to Mr. Finnerty here, if I find that I am excluded on this
      occasion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you do succeed,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;I would advise you to hire a
      loose translator during the remainder of your residence among us; for upon
      my veracity, Dionysius, the King&rsquo;s English will perform hard duty until
      you enter Maynooth. Not a word under six feet will be brought into the
      ranks&mdash;grenadiers every one of them, not to mention the thumpers you
      will coin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Docthor Finnerty,&rdquo; said our candidate, pulling up a little, &ldquo;if the
      base Latin which you put into circulation were compared with my English
      thumpers, it would be found that of the two, I am more legitimate and
      etymological.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be happy to dispute that point with you another time,&rdquo; said the
      priest, &ldquo;when we can&mdash;Silence, here comes the Counsellor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. O&rsquo;Shaughnessy,&rdquo; said the lawyer, addressing the candidate, &ldquo;allow me
      to congratulate you on your success! Your business is accomplished. The
      Bishop is just finishing a letter for you to the President of Maynooth. I
      assure you, I feel great pleasure at your success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accept my thanks, sir,&rdquo; said Denis, whose eye was instantly lit up with
      delight&mdash;&ldquo;accept my most obsequious thanks to the very furthest
      extent of my gratitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Barrister then shook hands with old Denis. &ldquo;O&rsquo;Shaughnessy,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;I am very happy that I have had it in my power to serve you and your
      son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Counsellor,&rdquo; said Denis, seizing his hand in both of his&mdash;&ldquo;Counsellor,
      <i>ahagur machree</i> Counsellor, oh, what&mdash;what&mdash;can I say!&mdash;Is
      he&mdash;is it possible&mdash;is it thruth that my boy is to go to
      Maynewth this time? Oh, if you knew, but knew, the heavy, dead weight you
      tuck off o&rsquo; my heart! Our son not cast aside&mdash;not disgraced!&mdash;for
      what else would the people think it? The horse!&mdash;a poor bit of a
      coult&mdash;a poor unsignified animal! To the devil wid him. What is he
      compared to the joy an&rsquo; delight of this minute? Take him, sir; take him&mdash;an&rsquo; 
      if he was worth his weight in goold, I vow to Heaven above me, I&rsquo;d not
      think him too good. Too good!&mdash;no, nor half good enough for you. God
      remimber this to you! an&rsquo; he will, too. Little you know the happiness you
      have given us, Counsellor! Little you know it. But no matther! An&rsquo; you,
      too, Father Finnerty, helped to bring this about. But sure you were ever
      an&rsquo; always our friend! Well, no matther&mdash;no matther! God will reward
      you both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother wishes me to see Mr. Finnerty and your son,&rdquo; said the
      barrister; &ldquo;I think they had better go up to him. He is anxious to get a
      slip of your shrub, Mr. Finnerty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I thought so,&rdquo; said the priest&mdash;&ldquo;I thought as much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop, on their reappearance, presented Denis with the long
      wished-for letter. He then gave him a suitable exhortation with reference
      to the serious and responsible duties for which he was about to prejjare
      himself. After concluding his admonition, he addressed Father Finnerty as
      follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now Mr. Finnerty, this matter has ended in a manner satisfactory, not
      only to your young friend, but to yourself. You must promise me that there
      shall be no more horse-dealing. I do not think jockeying of that
      description either creditable or just. I am unwilling to use harsher
      language, but I could not conscientiously let it pass without reproof. In
      the next place, will you let me have a slip of that flowering shrub you
      boast of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;is it possible you ask it of me? Why, I think
      your lordship ought to know that it&rsquo;s your own, as is every plant and
      flower in my garden that you fancy. Do you dine at home to-morrow, my
      lord?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said the Bishop. &ldquo;Well, then, I shall come up with a slip or two
      of it, and dine with you. I know the situation in which it grows best; and
      knowing this, I will put it down with my own hands. But I protest, my
      lord, against you allowing me to be traced in the business of the shrub at
      all, otherwise I shall have the whole county on my back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be under no apprehension of that, Mr. Finnerty. I shall be happy if you
      dine with me; but bring it with you. How did you come to get it so early
      after its appearance in this country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got it from headquarters, Doctor&mdash;-from one of the best botanists
      in the three kingdoms; certainly from the best Irish botanist living&mdash;my
      friend, Mr Mackay, of the College Botanic Gardens. My lord, I wish you
      good morning; but before I go, accept my thanks for your kindness to my
      young friend. I assure you he will be a useful man; for he is even now no
      indifferent casuist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I, my lord,&rdquo; said Denis, &ldquo;return you my most grateful&mdash;hem&mdash;my
      most grateful&mdash;and&mdash;most supercilious thanks for the favor&mdash;the
      stupendous favor you have conferred upon me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you, my dear child,&rdquo; returned the bishop; &ldquo;but if you be
      advised by me, speak more intelligibly. Use plain words, and discard all
      difficult and pedantic expressions. God bless you! Farewell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On coming down, they found old Denis in the stable-yard in rather a
      ridiculous kind of harness. The saddle that had been on the colt was
      strapped about him with the bridle, for both had been borrowed from a
      neighbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dionnisis an&rsquo; I must both ride the same horse,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;an&rsquo; as we have
      two saddles, I must carry one of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An altercation then ensued as to which should ride foremost. The son, now
      in high glee, insisted on the father&rsquo;s taking the seat of honor; but the
      father would not hear of this. The lad was, in his opinion, at least
      semi-clerical, and to ride behind would be a degradation to so learned a
      youth. They mounted at length, the son foremost, and the father on the
      crupper, the saddle strapped about him, with the stirrups dangling by the
      horse&rsquo;s flanks. Father Finnerty, who accompanied them, could not, however,
      on turning from the bishop&rsquo;s grounds into the highway, get a word out of
      them. The truth is, both their hearts were full; both were, therefore,
      silent, and thought every minute an hour until they reached home.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was but natural. A man may conceal calamity or distress even from his
      dearest friends; for who is there who wishes to be thrust back from his
      acknowledged position in life? Or who, when he is thrust back, will not
      veil his misfortunes or his errors with the guise of indifference or
      simulation? In good fortune we act differently. It is a step advanced; an
      elevation gained; there is nothing to fear, or to be ashamed of, and we
      are strongly prompted by vanity to proclaim it to the world, as we are by
      pride to ascribe its occurrence to our own talents or virtues. There are
      other and purer motives for this. The affections will not be still; they
      seek the hearts to which they tend; and having found them, the mutual
      interchange of good takes place. Father Finnerty&mdash;whose heart, though
      a kind one, had, probably, been too long out of practice to remember the
      influence and working of the domestic affections&mdash;could not
      comprehend the singular conduct of the two O&rsquo;Shaughnessys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil is the matter with you?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;Have you lost the
      use of your speech?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Push an&rsquo; avourneen,&rdquo; said the father to Denis&mdash;&ldquo;push an; lay the
      spur to him. Isn&rsquo;t your spur on the right foot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly,&rdquo; said Denis, now as pedantic as ever&mdash;&ldquo;most
      certainly it is. You are not to be informed that our family spur is a
      right-foot spur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, Peter Gallagher&rsquo;s spur that I have an is a left-foot spur,
      for it&rsquo;s an my left foot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a bright pair,&rdquo; said the priest, somewhat nettled at their
      neglect of him&mdash;&ldquo;you are a bright pair, and deeply learned in spurs.
      Can&rsquo;t you ride asier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never heed him,&rdquo; said the father, in a whisper; &ldquo;do you, give the mare
      the right spur, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll give her the left. Push an! that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They accordingly dashed forwrard, Denis plying, one heel, and the father
      another, until the priest found himself gradually falling behind. In vain
      he plied both spurs; in vain he whipped, and wriggled on the saddle, and
      pressed forwrard his hack. Being a priest&rsquo;s horse, the animal had been
      accustomed for the last twelve years to a certain jog-trot-pace, beyond
      which it neither would nor could go. On finding all his efforts to
      overtake them unsuccessful, he at last shouted after them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you call that gratitude, my worthy friends? To lave me creeping over
      the ups and downs of this villanous road without company?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lay an, aroon,&rdquo; said the father. &ldquo;Let us get home. Oh, how your poor
      mother will die with joy, an&rsquo; Susy, an&rsquo; Nanny, an&rsquo; Brian, an&rsquo; Michael, an&rsquo; 
      Dick, an&rsquo; Lanty, an&rsquo; all o&rsquo; them. Glory be to Heaven! what a meetin&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll
      have! An&rsquo; the nabors, too! Push an&rsquo; avick machree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My curse upon you, Friar Hennessy!&rdquo; exclaimed the priest, in a soliloquy,
      &ldquo;it was you who first taught this four-footed snail to go like a thief to
      the gallows. I wish to Heaven you had palmed him on some one else, for
      many a dinner I have lost by him in my time. Is that your gratitude,
      gentlemen? Do I deserve this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is he sayin&rsquo;?&rdquo; said the father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is declaiming about gratitude,&rdquo; replied Denis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lay-an&rsquo; her,&rdquo; said the father. &ldquo;Poor Mave!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such conduct does you credit,&rdquo; shouted the priest. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the way of
      the world. You have got what you wanted out of me, an&rsquo; now you throw me
      off. However, go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said the father again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is desiring us to go on,&rsquo; replied the son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, in the name o&rsquo; Goodness, do so, avourneen. Susy will die
      downright.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where am I to dine to-day?&rdquo; shouted the priest, in a louder voice. &ldquo;I
      say, where am I to come in for my dinner, for I&rsquo;m not expected at home,
      and my curate dines out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hear him,&rdquo; said the father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says the curate dines out; an&rsquo; he wants to know if he&rsquo;s to dine with
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throth, an&rsquo; he won&rsquo;t; not that we begrudge it to him; but for this day
      the sarra one we&rsquo;ll have but our own relations. Push an. An&rsquo; Brian, too,
      poor fellow, that was always so proud of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had now reached the top of an ascent on the road, whilst the priest
      toiled up after them. In a few minutes they began to descend, and
      consequently were out of his sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      No description of mine could give an adequate perception to the reader of
      what was felt by the family on hearing that the object of Denis&rsquo;s hopes,
      and their own proud ambition, was at length accomplished. The Bishop&rsquo;s
      letter was looked at, turned in every direction, and the seal inspected
      with a kind of wonderful curiosity, such as a superstitious person would
      manifest on seeing and touching some sacred relic. The period appointed
      for his departure now depended upon the despatch with which they could
      equip him for college. But until this event should arrive, his friends
      lost no opportunity of having him among them. Various were the treats he
      got in fair and markets. Proud were his relations when paying&rsquo; him the
      respect which he felt right sincere pleasure in receiving. The medium
      between dignity and humility which he hit off in these scenes, was worthy
      o&rsquo;f being recorded; but, to do him justice, his forte lay in humility. He
      certainly condescended with a grace, and made them feel the honor done
      them by his vouchsafing to associate with such poor creatures as if he was
      one of themselves. To do them also justice, they appeared to feel his
      condescension; and, as a natural consequence, were ready to lick the very
      dust under his feet, considering him, as they did, a priest in everything
      but ordination.

      Denis, besides his intercourse with humble relatives, was now asked to
      dine with the neighboring clergymen, and frequently made one at their
      parties. In the beginning, his high opinion and awe of the clerical
      character kept him remarkably dull and sheepish. Many an excellent joke
      was cracked at his expense; and often did he ask himself what Phadrick
      Murray, his father&rsquo;s family, or his acquaintances in general, would say,
      if they saw his learning and his logic so villanously degraded. In
      proportion, however, as conviviality developed among his reverend friends
      many defects, opinions, and failings, which he never suspected them to
      possess, so did he begin to gather courage and facility of expression. By
      degrees he proceeded modestly from the mild and timid effort at wit to the
      steadier nerve of moderate confidence&mdash;another step brought him to
      the indifference of a man who can bear an unsuccessful attempt at
      pleasantry, without being discomposed; the third and last stage advanced
      him to downright assurance, which having reached, he stopped at nothing.
      From this forward he began to retort upon his clerical companions, who
      found that the sheepish youth whom they had often made ridiculous,
      possessed skill, when properly excited, to foil them at their own weapons.
      He observed many things in their convivial meetings. The holy man, whom
      his flock looked upon as a being of the highest sanctity, when lit up into
      fun and frolic, Denis learned to estimate at his just value. He thought,
      besides, that a person resolved to go to heaven, had as good a chance of
      being saved by the direct mercy of God, as through the ministration of
      men, whose only spiritual advantage over himself consisted in the mere
      fact of being in orders. To be sure, he saw the usual exceptions among
      them that are to be found among every other class; but he drew his
      conclusions from the general rule. All this, however, failed in removing
      that fundamental principle of honest superstition in which he had been
      trained. The clergymen whom he saw were only a few who constituted the
      great body of the church; but when the long and sanctified calendar of
      saints and miracles opened upon him, there still remained enough to throw
      a dim and solemn charm of shadowy pomp around the visions of a mind
      naturally imaginative.

      Messengers were once more sent abroad, to inform their friends of his
      triumph, who, on ascertaining that his journey was fixed for an early day,
      lost no time in pouring in, each with some gift suited to their
      circumstances. Some of these were certainly original, the appropriateness
      having been in every case determined by the wealth or poverty, ignorance,
      or knowledge, of those who offered them. Some poor relation, for instance,
      brought him a shirt or two of materials so coarse, that to wear it in a
      college would be out of the question; others offered him a pair of
      brogues, much too vulgar for the society he was about to enter; others,
      again, would present him with books&mdash;for it is not at all uncommon to
      find in many illiterate Irish families half-a-dozen old volumes of whose
      contents they are ignorant, lying in a dusty corner, where they are kept
      till some young scion shall be sufficiently instructed to peruse them. The
      names of these were singular enough. One presented him with &ldquo;The Necessity
      of Penance;&rdquo; another with &ldquo;Laugh and be Fat;&rdquo; a third with the &ldquo;Key of
      Paradise;&rdquo; a fourth with &ldquo;Hell Open;&rdquo; a fifth handed him a copy of the
      &ldquo;Irish Rogues and Rapparees; a sixth gave him &ldquo;Butler&rsquo;s Lives of Saints;&rdquo;
       a seventh &ldquo;The Necessity of Fasting;&rdquo; an eighth &ldquo;The Epicure&rsquo;s <i>Vade
      Mecum</i>.&rdquo; The list ran on very ludicrously. Among them were the &ldquo;Garden
      of Love and Royal Flower of Fidelity;&rdquo; &ldquo;An Essay on the Virtue of
      Celibacy;&rdquo; and another &ldquo;On the Increase of Population in Ireland.&rdquo; To
      these we may add &ldquo;The Devil upon Two Sticks,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Life of St.
      Anthony.&rdquo;
     </p>

      &ldquo;Take these, Misther Denis,&rdquo; said the worthy souls; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re of no use to
      us at all at all; but they&rsquo;ll sarve you, of coorse, where you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo;,
      bekase when you want books in the college you can use them.&rdquo;

      Honest Phadrick Murray, in lieu of a more valuable present, brought him
      his wife&rsquo;s largest and best shawl as a pocket handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Katty, sir, sent you this,&rdquo; said Phadrick, &ldquo;as a pocket handkerchy; an&rsquo; 
      be gorra, Mither Denis, if you begin at this corner, an&rsquo; take it out o&rsquo;

      Another neighbor came with a <i>cool</i> of rendered lard, hoping it might
      be serviceable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Norah, sir,&rdquo; said the honest friend who brought it, &ldquo;sent you a&rsquo; crock of
      her own lard. When, you&rsquo;re makin&rsquo; colcanon, sir, or <i>sthilk</i>,* in the
      college, if you slip in a lamp of this, it&rsquo;ll save you the price of
      bufther. The grace &lsquo;ill be useful to you, whether or not; an&rsquo; they say
      there&rsquo;s a scarcity of it in the college.&rdquo;.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Sthilk is made by bruising a quantity of boiled
     Potatoes and beans together. The potatoes, however,
     having first been reduced to a pulpy state, the beans
     are but partially broken. It is then put into dish, and
     a pound of butter or rendered lard thrust into the
     middle of it.

      A third brought him an oak sapling to keep in his hand about the purlieus

      &ldquo;We know,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;re given to arguin&rsquo; an&rsquo; to that thing you
      call logic, Misther Denis. Now, sir, if you&rsquo;re ever hard set in an
      argument or the like o&rsquo; that, or if any o&rsquo; the shthudjeents &lsquo;ud be
      throuble-some or imperant, why give them a touch o&rsquo; this&mdash;a lick of
      it, do you see; jist this a way. First come wid a back sthroke upon the

      have time to recover, come down wid a visitation upon the kidney, My life

      more than it does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Denis, &ldquo;that is what they call&mdash;in the books the <i>argumentum
      baculinum</i>. I accept your present, Roger; but I flatter myself I shall
      be a match for any of the collegians without having recourse to the
      argumentum baculinum.&rdquo;

      A poor old widow, who was distantly related to them, came upwards of four
      miles with two or three score of eggs, together with a cock and hen; the
      eggs for his own use, and the latter for breeding in Maynooth. &ldquo;Avourneen,
      Misther O&rsquo;Shaughnessy,&rdquo; said she, in broken English, &ldquo;when you ate out all
      the eggs, maybe you could get a sonsy little corner about the collegian
      that you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to larn to be a priest in, an&rsquo; put them both into it; &ldquo;&mdash;pointing
      at the same time to the cock and hen&mdash;&ldquo;an&rsquo; whishper,&rdquo; she continued,
      in a low friendly voice, &ldquo;if you could get a weeshy wisp o&rsquo; sthraw, an
      slip it undher your own bed, it would make a nest for them, an&rsquo; they&rsquo;d lay
      an egg for your breakfast all days in the year. But, achora, don&rsquo;t let
      them be widout a nest egg; an&rsquo; whishper&mdash;maybe you&rsquo;d breed a clackin&rsquo; 
      out o&rsquo; them, that you might sell. Sure they&rsquo;d help to buy duds of cloes
      for you; or you might make presents of the crathurs to the blessed an&rsquo; 
      holy collegian himself. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be good to have him an your side?&mdash;He&rsquo;d
      help to make a gintleman of you, any way. Faix, sure he does it for many,
      they say. An&rsquo; whishper&mdash;the breed, avourneen, is good; an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m not
      afeard to say that there never was sich a chicken in the whole collegian,
      as the ould cock himself. He&rsquo;s the darlin&rsquo; all out, an&rsquo; can crow so
      stoutly, that it bates the world. Sure his comb&rsquo;s a beauty to look at, the
      darlin&rsquo;; an&rsquo; only it&rsquo;s to yourself, an&rsquo; in regard of the blessed place
      he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to, I wouldn&rsquo;t part wid him to nobody whatsomever, at all, good
      or bad.&rdquo;

      The most original gift of all was a purse, formed of a small bladder,
      ingeniously covered with silk. It was given to him by his uncle, as a
      remembrance of him, in the first place; and secondly, for a more special
      purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will sarve you, sir,&rdquo; said his uncle, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll tell you how: if you
      want to smuggle in a sup of good whiskey&mdash;as of coorse you will,
      plase goodness&mdash;why this houlds exactly a pint, an&rsquo; is the very thing
      for it. The sorra one among them will ever think of searchin&rsquo; your purse,
      at least for whiskey. Put it in your pocket, Misther Dionmsis; an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d
      take it as a great kindness if you&rsquo;d write me a scrape or two of the pen,
      mentionin&rsquo; what a good parish &lsquo;ud be worth: you&rsquo;ll soon be able to tell
      me, for I&rsquo;ve some notion myself of puttin&rsquo; Barny to Latin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis was perfectly aware of the honest warmth of heart with which these
      simple tokens of esteem were presented to him; and young as he was, his
      knowledge of their habits and prejudices prevented him from disappointing
      them by a refusal. He consequently accepted everything offered him,
      appropriated to himself whatever was suitable to his wants, converted the
      remainder into pocket-money, and, of course, kept his conscience void of
      offence toward them all: a state of Christian virtue which his refusal of
      any one gift would have rendered difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day before his departure the friends and relations of the family
      assembled to hold their farewell meeting. The same spirit which marked all
      their rustic symposia presided in this; if we except a feeling of sorrow
      natural to his family on being separated from one they loved so
      affectionately. Denis, who was never deficient in warmth of feeling, could
      not be insensible to the love and pride with which his family had always
      looked upon him. Ambition, as he approached it, lost much of its
      fictitious glitter. A sense of sorrow, if not of remorse, for the
      fastidious and overbearing spirit he had manifested to them, pressed upon
      his heart. Pride, in fact, was expelled; nature resumed her empire over
      him; he looked upon the last two months of his life as a man would be apt
      to do who had been all that time under the dominion of a feverish dream.
      We do not say, however, that either ambition or superstition was
      thoroughly expelled from his mind; for it is hard at all times to root
      them out of the system of man: but they ceased to govern him altogether. A
      passion, too, as obstinate as either of them, was determined to dispute
      their power. The domestic affections softened his heart; but love, which
      ambition left for dead, was only stunned; it rose again, and finding a
      favorable position, set its seal to his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denis himself, some days before that appointed for his departure, became
      perfectly conscious that his affections were strongly fixed upon Susan
      Connor. The nature of their last interview filled him with shame; nay,
      more, it inspired him with pity for the fair, artless girl whom he had so
      unfeelingly insulted. The manner in which he had won her young affections;
      the many tender interviews that had passed between them; the sacred
      promises of unchangeable love they had made to each other: all crowded to
      his imagination with a power which reduced his spiritual ambition and
      ecclesiastical pride, at least to the possession only of a divided empire.
      He had, therefore, with his book in his hand as usual, taken many solitary
      walks for the preceding few days, with the expectation of meeting Susan.
      He heard that for the last month or six weeks she had looked ill, been in
      low spirits, and lost her health. The cause of this change, though a
      secret to the world, was known to him. He knew, indeed, that an interview
      between them was indispensable; but had it not been so, we question
      whether he would have been able to leave home without seeing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      His evening strolls, however, up until the day before his setting out for
      college, were fruitless. Susan, who heretofore had been in the habit of
      walking in the evenings among the green dells around her father&rsquo;s house,
      was ever since their last meeting almost invisible. In the meantime, as
      the day before that of his leaving the neighborhood had arrived, and as an
      interview with her was, in a religious point of view, essentially
      necessary, he took his book in the course of the evening, and by a path
      slightly circuitous, descended the valley that ran between his father&rsquo;s
      house and hers. With solemn strides he perambulated it in every direction&mdash;north,
      south, east, and west; not a natural bower in the glen was unexplored; not
      a green, quiet nook unsearched; not a shady tree unexam-ined; but all to
      no purpose. Yet, although he failed in meeting herself, a thousand objects
      brought her to his heart. Every dell, natural bower, and shady tree,
      presented him with a history of their past affections. Here was the spot
      where, with beating heart and crimson cheek, she had first breathed out in
      broken music the acknowledgment of her love; there had another stolen
      meeting, a thousand times the sweeter for being stolen, taken place. Every
      spot, in fact, was dear to him, and every object associated itself with
      delightful emotions that kindled new life in a spirit from which their
      parent affections had not yet passed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denis now sought the only other place where he had any likelihood of
      meeting her: this was at the well below her father&rsquo;s house. He walked down
      along the banks of the little stream that ran past it, until he reached a
      thorn bush that grew within a few yards of the spring. Under this he sat,
      anxiously hoping that Susan might come to fill her evening pail, as he
      knew she was wont to do. A thick flowery branch of the hawthorn, for it
      was the latter end of May, hung down from the trunk, and served as a
      screen through which he could observe her should she appear, without being
      visible himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now the hour of twilight; the evening was warm and balmy; the
      whitethorn tinder which he sat, and the profusion of wild flowers that
      spangled the bosom of the green glen, breathed their fragrance around him,
      and steeped, the emotions and remembrances which crowded thickly on him in
      deep and exquisite tenderness. Up in the air he heard the quavering hum of
      the snipe, as it rose and fell in undulating motion, and the creak of the
      rail in many directions around him. From an adjoining meadow in the
      distance, the merry voices of the village children came upon his ear, as
      they gathered the wild honey which dropped like dew from the soft clouds
      upon the long grassy stalks, and meadow-sweet, on whose leaves it lay like
      amber. He remembered when he and Susan, on meeting there for a similar
      purpose, felt the first mysterious pleasure in being together, and the
      unaccountable melancholy produced by separation and absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he heard a footstep; but he could not persuade himself that the
      slow and lingering tread of the person approaching him was that of Susan,
      so much did it differ from the buoyant and elastic step with which she
      used to trip along. On looking through the branches, however, he perceived
      her coming towards him, carrying the pitcher as usual in her hand. The
      blood was already careering at full speed through his veins, and the
      palpitations of his heart were loud enough to be heard by the ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, beauty, beauty! <i>terrima causa belli</i>, thou dost play the devil
      with the hearts of men! Who is there who doth not wish to look upon thee,
      from the saint to the sinner?&mdash;None. For thee worlds have been lost;
      nations swept off the earth; thrones overturned; and cities laid in ashes!
      Adam, David, Marc Antony, Abelard, and Denis O&rsquo;Shaughnessy, exhibit
      histories of thy power never to be forgotten, but the greatest of these is
      Denis O&rsquo;Shaughnessy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan was about the middle size; her tresses, like those of the daughters
      of her country, were a fair brown, and abundant. Her features were not
      such, we admit, as mark regular and scientific perfection, and perhaps
      much of their power was owing to their not being altogether symmetrical.
      Her great charm consisted in a spirit of youthful innocence, so guileless
      that the very light of purity and truth seemed to break in radiance from
      her countenance. Her form was round, light, and flexible. When she smiled
      her face seemed to lose the character of its mortality&mdash;so seraphic
      and full of an indescribable spell were its lineaments; that is, the spell
      was felt by its thrilling influence upon the beholder, rather than by any
      extraordinary perception of her external beauty. The general expression of
      her countenance, however, was that of melancholy. No person could look
      upon her! white forehead and dark flashing eyes, without perceiving that
      she was full of tenderness and enthusiasm; but let the light of
      cheerfulness fall upon her face, and you wished never to see it beam with
      any other spirit. In her met those extremes of character peculiar to her
      country. Her laughing lips expanded with the playful delicacy of mirth, or
      breathed forth, with untaught melody and deep pathos, her national songs
      of sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little before she made her appearance, the moon had risen and softened
      with her dewy light the calm secluded scene around them. Denis, too, had
      an opportunity of seeing the lovely girl more distinctly. Her dress was
      simple but becoming. Her hair, except the side ringlets that fell to
      heighten the beauty of her neck, was bound up with a comb which Denis
      himself had presented to her. She wore a white dimity bedgown, that sat
      close to her well-formed person, descended below her knee, and opened
      before; the sleeves of it did not reach the elbow, but displayed an arm
      that could not be surpassed for whiteness and beauty. The bedgown was
      frilled about the shoulder, which it covered, leaving the neck only, and
      the upper part of her snowy bosom, visible. A dark ribbon, tied about her
      waist, threw her figure into exquisite outline, and gave her that simple
      elegance which at once bespeaks the harmony of due proportion.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the well she filled her vessel, and placed it on a small mound
      beside her; then sitting down, she mused for some time, and turning her
      eyes towards Denis&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s sighed deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the least,&rdquo; said the humble girl, &ldquo;that I may look towards the house
      that the only one I ever loved, or ever will love, lives in. Little I
      thought when I loved him that I was standin&rsquo; between him an&rsquo; God. Loved
      him! I wish I could say it was past. I wish I could: for I am afeared that
      till my weak heart breaks it will love him still. God pity me! It would be
      well for me I had never seen him! But why he should go to Maynooth without
      givin&rsquo; me back my promise I cannot tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis rose and approached her. Susan, on seeing him, started, and her
      lover could perceive that she hastily wiped the tears from her eyes. A
      single glance, however, convinced her that it was he; and such was the
      guileless simplicity of her heart, joined to the force of habit, that her
      face beamed with one of her wonted smiles at his appearance. This soon
      passed away, and her features again resumed an expression of deep
      melancholy. Our hero now forgot his learning; his polysyllables were laid
      aside, and his pedantry utterly abandoned. His pride, too, was gone, and
      the petty pomp of artificial character thing aside like an unnecessary
      garment which only oppresses the wearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Susan,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am sorry to see you look so pale and unhappy. I
      deeply regret it; and I could not permit this day to pass, without seeing
      and speaking to you. If I go to-morrow, Susan, may I now ask in what light
      will you remember me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remember you without anger, Denis; with sorrow will I remember you,
      but not, as I said, in anger; though God knows, and you know, the only
      token you lave me to remember you by is a broken heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Susan,&rdquo; said Denis, &ldquo;it was an unhappy attachment, as circumstances have
      turned out; and I wish for both our sakes we had never loved one another.
      For some time past my heart has been torn different ways, and, to tell you
      the truth, I acknowledge that within the last three or four months I have
      been little less than a villain to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak harshly of yourself, Denis; I hope, more so than you deserve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Susy. With my heart fixed upon other hopes, I continued to draw your
      affections closer and closer to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that was wrong, Denis; but you loved me long before that time, an&rsquo; 
      it&rsquo;s not so asy a thing to draw away the heart from what we love; that is,
      to draw it away for ever, Denis, even although greater things may rise up
      before us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she pronounced the last words, her voice, which she evidently strove to
      keep firm, became unsteady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, Susan, I know it; but I will never forgive myself for acting
      a double part to you and to the world. There is not a pang you suffer but
      ought to fall as a curse upon my head, for leading you into greater
      confidence, at a time when I was not seriously resolved to fulfil my vows
      to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Denis,&rdquo; said the unsuspecting girl, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re imposin&rsquo; on yourself&mdash;you
      never could do so bad, so treacherous an act as that. No, you never could,
      Denis; an&rsquo;, above all the world, to a heart that loved and trusted you as
      mine did. I won&rsquo;t believe it, even from your own lips. You surely loved
      me, Denis, and in that case you couldn&rsquo;t be desateful to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did love you; but I never loved you half so well as I ought, Susy; and
      I never was worthy of you. Susy, I tell you&mdash;I tell you&mdash;my
      heart is breaking for your sake. It would have been well for both of us we
      had never seen, or known, or loved each other; for I know by my own heart
      what you must suffer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Denis, don&rsquo;t be cast down on my account; before I ever thought of you,
      when I was runnin&rsquo; about the glens here, a lonely little orphan, I was
      often sorry, without knowin&rsquo; why. Sometimes I used to wonder at it, and
      search my mind to find out what occasioned it: but I never could. I
      suppose it was because I saw other girls, like myself, havin&rsquo; their little
      brothers an&rsquo; sisters to play with or because I had no mother&rsquo;s voice to
      call me night or mornin&rsquo;, or her bosom to lay my head on, if I was sick or
      tired. I suppose it was this. Many a time, Denis, even then, I knew what
      sorrow was, and I often thought that, come what would to others, there was
      sorrow before me. I now find I was right; but for all that, Denis, it&rsquo;s
      betther that we should give up one another in time, than be unhappy by my
      bein&rsquo; the means of turning you from the ways and duties of God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The simple and touching picture which she drew of her orphan childhood,
      together with the tone of resignation and sorrow which ran through all she
      said, affected Denis deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Susan,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I am much changed of late. The prospect before me is
      a dark one&mdash;a mysterious one. It is not many months since my head was
      dizzy with the gloomy splendor which the pomps and ceremonies of the
      Church&mdash;soon, I trust, to be restored in this country to all her
      pride and power&mdash;presented to my imagination. But I have mingled with
      those on whom before this&mdash;that is, during my boyhood&mdash;I looked
      with awe, as on men who held vested in themselves some mysterious and
      spiritual power. I have mingled with them, Susan, and I find them neither
      better nor worse than those who still look upon them as I once did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but, Denis, how does that bear upon your views?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does, Susan. I said I have found them neither better nor worse than
      their fellow-creatures; but I believe they are not so happy. I think I
      could perceive a gloom, even in their mirth, that told of some particular
      thought or care that haunted them like a spirit. Some of them and not a
      few, in the moments of undisguised feeling, dissuaded me against ever
      entering the Church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure they&rsquo;re happy,&rdquo; said Susan. &ldquo;Some time ago, accordin&rsquo; to your
      own words, you thought the same; but something has turned your heart from
      the good it was fixed upon. You&rsquo;re in a dangerous time, Denis; and it&rsquo;s
      not to be wondhered at, if the temptations of the devil should thry you
      now, in hopes to turn you from the service of God. This is a warnin&rsquo; to
      me, too, Denis. May Heaven above forbid that I should be made the means of
      temptin&rsquo; you from the duty that&rsquo;s before you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Susan, dear, it&rsquo;s not temptation, but the fear of temptation, that
      prevails with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Denis, surely if you think yourself not worthy to enter that blessed
      state, you have time enough to avoid it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but, Susy, there is the difficulty. I am now so placed that I can
      hardly go back. First, the disgrace of refusing to enter the Church would
      lie upon me as if I had committed a crime. Again, I would break my
      father&rsquo;s and my mother&rsquo;s heart: and rather than do that, I could almost
      submit to be miserable for life. And finally, I could not live in the
      family, nor bear the indignation of my brothers and other relations. You
      know, Susan, as well as I do, the character attached to those who put
      their friends to the expense of educating them for the Church, who raise
      their hopes and their ambition, and afterwards disappoint them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, Susan, dear, prevails with me. Besides, the Church now is likely to
      rise from her ruins. I believe that if a priest did his duty, he might
      possibly possess miraculous power. There is great pomp and splendor in her
      ceremonies, a sense of high and boundless authority in her pastors; there
      is rank in her orders sufficient even for ambition. Then the deference,
      the awe, and the humility with which they are approached by the people&mdash;ah!
      Susan, there is much still in the character of a priest for the human
      heart to covet. The power of saying mass, of forgiving sin, of relieving
      the departed spirits of the faithful in another world, and of mingling in
      our holy sacrifices, with the glorious worship of the cherubims, or
      angels, in heaven&mdash;all this is the privilege of a priest, and what
      earthly rank can be compared to it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None at all, Denis&mdash;none at all. Oh, think this way still, and let
      no earthly temptation&mdash;no&mdash;don&rsquo;t let&mdash;even me&mdash;what am
      I?&mdash;a poor humble girl&mdash;oh! no, let nothing keep you back from
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tears burst from her eyes, however, as she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Denis,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;there is one thing that turns my brain. I fear
      that, even afther your ordination, I couldn&rsquo;t look upon you as I would
      upon another man. Oh, my heart would break if one improper thought of it
      was fixed upon you then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Susy, hear me. I could give up all, but you. I could bear to disappoint
      father, mother, and all; but the thought of giving you up for ever is
      terrible. I have been latterly in a kind of dream. I have been among
      friends and relatives until my brain was turned; but now I am restored to
      myself, and I find I cannot part with you. I would gladly do it; but I
      cannot. Oh, no, Susan, dear, my love for you was dimmed by other passions;
      but it was not extinguished. It now burns stronger and purer in my heart
      than ever. It does&mdash;it does. And, Susan, I always loved you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susan paused for some time, and unconsciously plucked a wild flower which
      grew beside her: she surveyed it a moment, and exclaimed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see this flower, Denis? it&rsquo;s a faded primrose. I&rsquo;m like that
      flower in one sense; I&rsquo;m faded; my heart&rsquo;s broke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my beloved Susan, don&rsquo;t say so; you&rsquo;re only low-spirited. Why should
      your heart be broke, and you in the very bloom of youth and beauty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember our last meetin&rsquo;, Denis? Oh, how could you be so cruel
      then as to bid me think of marryin&rsquo; another, as if I had loved you for
      anything but yourself? I&rsquo;m but a simple girl, Denis, and know but little
      of the world; but if I was to live a thousand years, you would always see
      the sorrow that your words made me feel visible upon my countenance. I&rsquo;m
      not angry with you, Denis; but I&rsquo;m telling you the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Susan, my darling, this is either weakness of mind or ill health. I will
      see you as beautiful and happy as ever. For my part, I now tell you, that
      no power on earth can separate us! Yes, my beloved Susan, I will see you
      as happy and happier than I have ever seen you. That will be when you are
      my own young and guileless wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, no, Denis! My mind is made up: I can never be your wife, Do you think
      that I would bring the anger of God upon myself, by temptin&rsquo; you back from
      the holy office you&rsquo;re entering into? Think of it yourself Denis. Your
      feelings are melted now by our discoorse, and, maybe, because I&rsquo;m near
      you; but when time passes, you&rsquo;ll be glad that in the moment of weakness
      you didn&rsquo;t give way to them. I know it&rsquo;s natural for you to love me now.
      You&rsquo;re lavin&rsquo; me&mdash;you&rsquo;re lavin&rsquo; the place where I am&mdash;the little
      river and the glen where we so often met, and where we often spent many a
      happy hour together. That has an effect upon you; for why should I deny it&mdash;you
      see it&mdash;it is hard&mdash;very hard&mdash;even upon myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She neither sobbed nor cried so as to be heard, but the tears gushed down
      her cheeks in torrents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Susan,&rdquo; said Denis, in an unsteady voice, &ldquo;you speak in vain. Every word
      you say tells me that I cannot live without you; and I will not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that, Denis. Suppose we should be married, think of what I
      would suffer if I saw you in poverty or distress, brought on because you
      married me! Why, my heart would sink entirely under it. Then your friends
      would never give me a warm heart. Me! they would never give yourself a,
      warm heart; and I would rather be dead than see you brought to shame, or
      ill-treatment, or poverty, on my account. Pray to God, Denis, to grant you
      grace to overcome whatever you feel for me. I have prayed both for you and
      myself. Oh, pray to him, Denis, sincerely, that he may enable you to
      forget that such, a girl&mdash;such an unhappy girl&mdash;as Susan Connor
      ever lived!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Denis was so much overcome that he could not restrain his tears. He
      gazed upon the melancholy countenance of the fair girl, in a delirium of
      love and admiration; but in a few minutes he replied:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Susan, your words are lost: I am determined. Oh! great heavens! what a
      treasure was I near losing! Susan, hear me: I will bear all that this
      world can inflict; I will bear shame, ill-treatment, anger, scorn, and
      every harsh word that may be uttered against me; I will renounce church,
      spiritual power, rank, honor; I will give up father and family&mdash;all&mdash;all
      that this world could flatter mo with: yes, I will renounce each and all
      for your sake! Do not dissuade me; my mind is fixed, and no power on earth
      can change it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Denis,&rdquo; she replied calmly, &ldquo;there is a power, and a weak power,
      too, that will change it; for I will change it. Don&rsquo;t think, Denis, that
      in arguin&rsquo; with you, against the feelin&rsquo;s of my own heart, I am doin&rsquo; it
      without sufferin&rsquo;. Oh, no, indeed! You know, Denis, I am a lonely girl;
      that I have neither brother, nor sister, nor mother to direct me.
      Sufferin&rsquo;!&mdash;Oh, I wish you knew it! Denis, you must forget me. I&rsquo;m
      hopeless now: my, heart, as I said, is broke, and I&rsquo;m strivin&rsquo; to fix it
      upon a happier world! Oh! if I had a mother or a sister, that I could,
      when my breast is likely to burst, throw myself in their arms, and cry and
      confess all I feel! But I&rsquo;m alone, and must bear all my own sorrows. Oh,
      Denis! I&rsquo;m not without knowin&rsquo; how hard the task is that I have set to
      myself. Is it nothing to give up all that the heart is fixed upon? Is it
      nothing to walk about this glen, and the green fields, to have one&rsquo;s eyes
      upon them, and to remember what happiness one has had in them, knowin&rsquo;, at
      the same time, that it&rsquo;s all blasted? Oh, is it nothing to look upon the
      green earth itself,and all its beauty&mdash;to hear the happy songs and
      the joyful voices of all that are about us&mdash;the birds singing
      sweetly, the music of the river flowin&rsquo;&mdash;to see the sun shinin&rsquo;, and
      to hear the rustlin&rsquo; of the trees in the warm winds of summer&mdash;to see
      and hear all this, and to feel that a young heart is brakin&rsquo;, or already
      broken within us&mdash;that we are goin&rsquo; to lave it all&mdash;all we loved&mdash;and
      to go down into the clay under us? Oh, Denis, this is hard;&mdash;bitter
      is it to me, I confess it; for something tells me it will be my fate
      soon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Susan&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear me out. I have now repated what I know I must suffer&mdash;what I
      know I must lose. This is my lot, and I must bear it. Now, Denis, will you
      grant your own Susan one request?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it was that my life should save yours, I would grant it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the last and only one I will ever ask of you. My health has been
      ill, Denis; my strength is gone, and I feel&rsquo; I am gettin&rsquo; worse every day:
      now when you hear that I am&mdash;that I am&mdash;gone,&mdash;will you
      offer up the first mass you say for my pace and rest in another world? I
      say the first, for you know there&rsquo;s more virtue in a first mass than in
      any other. Your Susan will be then in the dust, and you may feel sorrow,
      but not love for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, Susan! For God&rsquo;s sake, forbear! You will drive me distracted. As I
      hope to meet judgment, I think I never loved you till now; and by the same
      oath, I will not change my purpose in making you mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you do love me still, Denis? And you would give up all for your
      Susan? Answer me truly, for the ear of God is open to our words and
      thoughts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, before God, I love you too strongly for words to express; and I
      would and will give up all for your sake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susan turned her eyes upon vacancy; and Denis observed that a sudden and
      wild light broke from them, which alarmed him exceedingly. She put her
      open hand upon her forehead, as if she felt pain, and remained glancing
      fearfully around her for a few minutes; her countenance, which became
      instantly like a sheet of paper, lost all its intelligence, except,
      perhaps, what might be gleaned from a smile of the most ghastly and
      desolating misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious heaven! Susan, dear, what&rsquo;s the matter? Oh, my God! your face is
      like marble! Dearest Susan, speak to me!&mdash;Oh, speak to me, or I will
      go distracted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked upon him long and steadily; but he perceived with delight that
      her consciousness was gradually returning. At length she drew a deep sigh,
      and requested him to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Denis,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you must now be a man. We can never be married. I am
      PROMISED TO ANOTHER!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Promised to another! Your brain is turned, Susy. Collect yourself,
      dearest, and think of what you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what I say&mdash;I know it too well! What did I say? Why&mdash;why,&rdquo;
       she added, with an unsettled look, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;m promised to another! It is
      true&mdash;true as God&rsquo;s in heaven. Oh, Denis! why did you lave me so&rsquo; 
      long without seein&rsquo; me? I said my heart was broke, and you will soon know
      that it has bitter, bitter rason to be so. See here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had, during her reply, taken from her bosom a small piece of brown
      cloth, of a square shape, marked with the letters I. M. I. the initials of
      the names of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. She kissed it fervently as she
      spoke, and desired Denis to look upon it and hear her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you saw me last,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I left you in anger, because I
      thought you no longer loved me. Many a scaldin&rsquo; tear I shed that nobody
      witnessed; many a wringin&rsquo; my heart felt since that time. I got low, and,
      as I said, my health left me. I began to think of what I ought to do; and
      bein&rsquo; so much&rsquo; alone, my thoughts were never off it. At last I remembered
      the Virgin Mother of God, as bein&rsquo; once a woman, and the likelier to pity
      one of her own kind in sorrow. I then thought of a scapular; and made a
      promise to myself, that if you didn&rsquo;t come within a certain time, I would
      dedicate myself to her for ever. I saw that you neglected me, and I heard
      so much of the way you spent your time, how you were pleasant and merry
      while my heart was breakin&rsquo;, that I made a vow to remain a spotless virgin
      all my life. I got a scapular, too, that I might be strengthened to keep
      my holy promise; for you didn&rsquo;t come to me within the time. This is it in
      my hand. It is now on me. The VOW IS MADE AND I AM MISERABLE FOB EVER!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis sobbed and wrung his hands, whilst tears, intensely bitter, fell
      from his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Susan!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;what have you done? Miserable! Oh you have
      ruined me utterly! You have rendered us both for ever miserable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miserable!&rdquo; she exclaimed with flashing eyes. &ldquo;Who talks of misery?&rdquo; But
      again she put her hand to her forehead, and endeavored to recollect
      herself. &ldquo;Denis,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;Denis, my brain is turning! Oh, I have no
      friend! Oh, mother, that I never seen, but as if it was in a dream;
      mother, daughter of your daughter&rsquo;s heart, look down from heaven, and.
      pity your orphan child in her sore trouble and affliction! Oh, how often
      did I miss you, mother darlin&rsquo;, durin&rsquo; all my life! In sickness I had not
      your tend her hands about me; in sorrow I could no&rsquo; hear your voice; and
      in joy and happiness you were never with me to share them! I had not your
      advice, my blessed mother, to guide and direct me, to tache me what was
      right and what was wrong! Oh, if you will not hear your own poor lonely
      orphan, who will you hear? if you will not assist her, who ought you to
      assist? for, as sure as I stand here this night, you are a blessed saint
      in heaven. But let me not forget the Virgin Queen of Heaven, that I am
      bound to. I kneel to you, Hope of the Afflicted! To you let them go that
      have a broken heart, as I have! Queen of Glory, pity me!&mdash;Star of the
      Sea&mdash;Comfort of the Hopeless&mdash;Refuge of Sinners, hear me,
      strengthen and support me! And you will, too. Who did you ever cast away,
      mild and beautiful Virgin of Heaven? As the lily among thorns, so are you
      among the daughters of Adam!* Yes, Denis, she will support me&mdash;she
      will support me! I feel her power on me now! I see the angels of heaven
      about her, and her mild countenance smilin&rsquo; sweetly upon the broken
      flower! Yes, Denis, her glory is upon me!&rdquo; The last words were uttered
      with her eyes flashing wildly as before, and her whole person and
      countenance evidently under the influence of a highly excited enthusiasm,
      or perhaps a touch of momentary insanity.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The form of the Service of the Virgin, from which
     most of the above expressions are taken is certainly
     replete with beauty and poetry.
</pre>
    <p>
      Poor Denis stood with streaming eyes, incapable of checking or
      interrupting her. He had always known that her education and understanding
      were above the common; but he never anticipated from her such capacity for
      deep feeling, united to so much vivacity of imagination as she then
      displayed. Perhaps he had not philosophy enough, at that period of his
      youth, to understand the effects of a solitary life upon a creature full
      of imagination and sensibility. The scenery about her father&rsquo;s house was
      wild, and the glens singularly beautiful; Susan lived among them alone, so
      that she became in a manner enamored of solitude; which, probably mote
      than anything else, gives tenderness to feeling and force to the
      imaginative faculties. Soon after she had pronounced the last words,
      however, her good sense came to her aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Denis,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you have seen my weakness; but you must now see my
      strength. You know we have a trial to go through before we part for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Susy, don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;for ever.&rsquo; You know that the vow you made was a rash
      vow. It may be set aside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not a rash vow, Denis. I made it with a firm intention of keepin&rsquo; 
      it, and keep it I will. The Mother of God is not to be mocked, because I
      am weak, or choose to prefer my own will to hers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Susy, the Church can dissolve it. You know she has power to bind and
      to loose. Oh, for God&rsquo;s sake, Susy, if you ever loved me, don&rsquo;t attempt to
      take back your promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you too well to destroy you, Denis. I will never stand between you
      and God, for that would be my crime. I will never bring disgrace, or
      shame, or poverty, upon you; for surely these things would fall upon you
      as a punishment for desartin&rsquo; him. If you were another&mdash;if you
      weren&rsquo;t intended to be the servant of God, I could beg with you&mdash;starve
      with you&mdash;die with you. But when I am gone, remember, that I gave up
      all my hopes, that you might succeed in yours. I&rsquo;m sure that is love. Now,
      Denis, we must return our promises, the time is passin&rsquo;, and we&rsquo;ll both be
      missed from home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Susan, for the sake of my happiness, both in this world and in the next,
      don&rsquo;t take away all hope. Make me not miserable and wretched; send me not
      into the church a hypocrite. If you do, I will charge you with my guilt; I
      will charge you with the crimes of a man who will care but little what he
      does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have friends, Denis; pious men, who will direct you and guide
      you and wean your heart from me and the world. You will soon bless me for
      this. Denis,&rdquo; she added, with a smile of unutterable misery, &ldquo;my mind is
      made up. I belong now to the Virgin Mother of God. I never will be so
      wicked as to forsake her for a mortal. If I was to marry you&mdash;with a
      broken vow upon me, I could not prosper. The curse of God and of his
      Blessed Mother would follow us both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis felt perfectly aware of the view entertained by Susan, respecting
      such a vow as she had taken. To reason with her, was only to attack a
      prejudice which scorned reason. Besides this, he was not himself
      altogether free from the impression of its being a vow too solemn to be
      broken without the sanction of the Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go,&rdquo; said Susan, &ldquo;to the same spot where we first promised. It was
      under this tree, in this month, last year. Let us give it back there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hand-promise in Ireland between the marriageable young of both sexes,
      is considered the most solemn and binding of all obligations. Few would
      rely upon the word or oath of any man who had been known to break a
      hand-promise. And, perhaps, few of the country girls would marry or
      countenance the addresses of a yoking person known to have violated such a
      pledge. The vow is a solemn one, and of course, given by mutual consent,
      by mutual consent, also, must it be withdrawn, otherwise, it is considered
      still binding. Whenever death removes one of the parties, without the
      other having had an opportunity of &ldquo;giving it back,&rdquo; the surviving party
      comes, and in the presence of witnesses first grasping the hand of the
      deceased, repeats the form of words usual in withdrawing it. Some of these
      scenes are very touching and impressive, particularly one which the author
      had an opportunity of witnessing. It is supposed that in cases of death,
      if the promise be not thus dissolved, the spirit of the departed returns
      and haunts the survivor until it be cancelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Denis and Susan had reached the hawthorn, they both knelt down. So
      exhausted, however, had Susan been by the agitation of her feelings, that
      Denis was under the necessity of assisting her to the place. He could
      perceive, too, that, amid the workings of her religious enthusiasm, she
      trembled like an aspen leaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you are stronger than I am, begin and repeat the words;
      I will repeat them with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Denis, &ldquo;I will never begin. I will never be the first to
      seal both your misery and mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am scarcely able,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;dear Denis, don&rsquo;t ask me to do what I
      have not strength for. But it&rsquo;s useless,&rdquo; she added; &ldquo;you will never begin
      unless I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They then blessed themselves after the form of their church, and as they
      extended their right hands to each other, the tears fell fast from the
      eyes of both. The words they repeated were the same, with the difference
      of the name only.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, Susan Connor, in the presence of God, do release you, Denis
      O&rsquo;Shaughnessy, from your promise of marriage to me, and from all promises
      of marriage that you ever made me. I now give you back that promise of
      marriage, and all promises of marriage you ever made me. To which I call
      God to witness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis repeated the same words, substituting the name of Susan Connor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sobs of Susan were loud and incessant, even before she had concluded
      the words; their eyes were fixed upon each other with a hopeless and
      agonizing expression: but no sooner were they uttered, than a strong
      hysteric sense of suffocation rose to her throat; she panted rapidly for
      breath; Denis opened his arms, and she fell, or rather threw herself, over
      in a swoon upon his bosom. To press his lips to hers, and carry her to the
      brink of the well, was but the work of a moment. There he laid her, and
      after having sprinkled her face with water, proceeded to slap the palms of
      her hands, exclaiming,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Susan, my beloved, will you not hear me? Oh, look upon me, my heart&rsquo;s
      dearest treasure, and tell me that you&rsquo;re living. Gracious God! her heart
      is broken&mdash;she is dead! This&mdash;this&mdash;is the severest blow of
      all! I have killed her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened her eyes as he spoke, and Denis, in stooping to assist her,
      weeping at the same time like a child; received&mdash;a bang from a cudgel
      that made his head ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sowl to the divil, you larned vagabone,&rdquo; said her father, for it was
      he, &ldquo;is this the way you&rsquo;re preparin&rsquo; yourself for the church? Comin&rsquo; over
      that innocent colleen of a daughter o&rsquo; mine before you set out,&rdquo; he added,
      taking Denis a second thwack across the shoulders&mdash;&ldquo;before you set
      out for Maynewth!!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you miserable vulgarian,&rdquo; said Denis, &ldquo;I scorn you from the head to
      the heel. Desist, I say,&rdquo; for the father was about to lay in another
      swinger upon his kidney&mdash;&ldquo;desist, I say, and don&rsquo;t approximate, or I
      will entangle the ribs of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sowl to glory,&rdquo; said the father, &ldquo;if ever I had a greater mind to ate
      my dinner, than I have to anoint you wid this cudgel, you black-coated
      skamer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out, you barbarian,&rdquo; replied Denis, &ldquo;how dare you talk about unction
      in connection with a cudgel? Desist, I say, for I will retaliate, if you
      approximate an inch. Desist, or I will baptize you in the well as Philip
      did the Ethiopian, without a sponsor. No man but a miserable barbarian
      would have had the vulgarity to interrupt us in the manner you did. Look
      at your daughter&rsquo;s situation!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hussy,&rdquo; replied the father, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the supper she ought to have ready,
      instead of coortin&rsquo; wid sich a larned vag&mdash;&mdash;Heavens above me!
      What ails my child? Susy! Susy, <i>alanna dhas!</i> what&rsquo;s over you? Oh, I
      see how it is,&rdquo; he continued&mdash;&ldquo;I see how it is! This accounts for her
      low spirits an&rsquo; bad health for some time past! Susy, rouse yourself,
      avourneen! Sure I&rsquo;m not angry wid you! My sowl to glory, Denis
      Shaughnessy, but you have broke my child&rsquo;s heart, I doubt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Owen,&rdquo; said Denis, &ldquo;your indecorous interruption has stamped you with the
      signature of genuine ignorance and vulgarity; still, I say, we must have
      some conversation on that subject immediately. Yes, I love your daughter a
      thousand times better than nay own life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, I&rsquo;ll take care that we&rsquo;ll have discoorse about it,&rdquo; replied the
      father. &ldquo;If you have been a villain to the innocent girl&mdash;if you
      have, Denny, why you&rsquo;ll meet your God sooner than you think. Mark my
      words. I have but one life, and I&rsquo;ll lose it for her sake, if she has come
      to ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo;, said Denis, &ldquo;let me sprinkle her face with this cool water, that
      we may recover her, if possible. Your anger and your outrage, Owen,
      overcame the timid creature. Speak kindly to her, she is recovering. Thank
      God, she is recovering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Susy, avourneen,&rdquo; said the father, &ldquo;rouse yourself,&rsquo; ma colleen; rouse
      yourself, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t thrimble that way. The sorra one o&rsquo; me&rsquo;s angry wid
      you, at all at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bring me home,&rdquo; said the poor girl. &ldquo;Father, dear, have no bad
      opinion of me. I done nothing, an&rsquo; I hope I never will do anything, that
      would bring the blush of shame to your face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s as true as that God&rsquo;s in heaven,&rdquo; observed Denis. &ldquo;The angels in
      his presence be not purer than she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take her own word for it,&rdquo; said the father; &ldquo;a lie, to the best of my
      knowledge, never came from her lips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us assist her home,&rdquo; said Denis. &ldquo;I told you that we must have some
      serious conversation about her. I&rsquo;ll take one arm, and do you take the
      other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do so,&rdquo; said the father, &ldquo;an&rsquo;, Denny, as you&rsquo;re the youngest and the
      strongest, jist take up that pitcher o&rsquo; wather in your hand, an&rsquo; carry it
      to the house above.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis, who was dressed in his best black from top to toe, made a wry face
      or two at this proposal. He was able, however, for Susan&rsquo;s sake, to
      compromise his dignity: so looking about him, to be certain that there was
      no other person observing them, he seized the pitcher in one hand, gave
      Susan his arm, and in this unheroic manner assisted to conduct her home.
    </p>
    <p>
      In about half an hour or better after this, Denis and Owen Connor
      proceeded in close and earnest conversation towards old Shaughnessy&rsquo;s. On
      entering, Denis requested to speak with his father and brothers in
      private.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this night is pregnant&mdash;that is, <i>vulgariter</i>,
      in the family way&mdash;with my fate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throth, it is, avick. Glory be to Goodness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is Owen Connor, an honest, dacent neighbor&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throth, he is an honest, dacent man, said the lather, interrupting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the son, &ldquo;I agree with you. Well, he has a certain
      disclosure or proposal to make, which you will be pleased to take into
      your most serious consideration. I, for my part, cannot help being endowed
      with my own gifts, and if I happen to possess a magnet to attract feminine
      sensibility, it is to heaven I owe it, and not to myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo;&mdash;said the father, &ldquo;glory be to his name!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed, or surprised, or angry, at anything Owen Connor may say
      to you. I speak significantly. There are perplexities in all human events,
      and the cardinal hinge of fate is forever turning. Now I must withdraw;
      but in, the meantime I will be found taking a serenade behind the garden,
      if I am wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brian,&rdquo; said the father, &ldquo;get the bottle; we can&rsquo;t on this night, any
      way, talk to Owen Connor, or to anybody else, wid dhry lips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bottle was accordingly got, and Owen, with no very agreeable
      anticipations, found himself compelled to introduce a very hazardous
      topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denis, as he said, continued to walk to and fro behind the garden. He
      thought over the incidents of the evening, but had no hope that Owen
      Connor&rsquo;s proposal would be accepted. He knew his father and family too
      well for that. With respect to Susan&rsquo;s vow, he felt certain that any
      change of opinion on her part was equally improbable. It was clear, then,
      that he had no pretext for avoiding Maynooth; and as the shame,
      affliction, and indignation of the family would, he knew, be terrible, he
      resolved to conform himself to his circumstances, trusting to absence for
      that diminution of affection which it often produces. Having settled these
      points in his mind, he began to grope that part of his head which had come
      in contact with Owen Connor&rsquo;s cudgel. He had strong surmises that a bump
      existed, and on examining, he found that a powerful organ of self-esteem
      had been created.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment he saw Owen Connor running past him at full speed, pursued
      by his father and brothers, the father brandishing a cudgel in his hand.
      The son, who understood all, intercepted the pursuers, commanding them, in
      a loud voice to stop. With his brothers he succeeded; but the father&rsquo;s
      wrath was not to be appeased so easily. Nothing now remained but to stand
      in his way, and arrest him by friendly violence; Denis, therefore, seized
      him, and, by assuming all his authority, at length prevailed upon him to
      give over the chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only think of him,&rdquo; exclaimed the father, breathless&mdash;&ldquo;only think of
      him havin&rsquo; the assurance to propose a match between you an&rsquo; his baby-faced
      daughter! Ho! <i>Dher manhim</i>, Owen Connor,&rdquo; he shouted, shaking the
      staff at Owen as he spoke&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Dher manhim!</i> if I was near you,
      I&rsquo;d put your bones through other, for darin&rsquo; to mintion sich a thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Owen Connor, on finding that he was na longer pursued, stood to
      reconnoitre the enemy:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Denis Oge,&rdquo; he shouted back, &ldquo;be on to Maynooth as fast as possible,
      except you wish to have my poor child left fatherless entirely. Go way,
      an&rsquo; my blessin&rsquo; be along wid you; but let there be never another word
      about that business while you live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Denis, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m scandalized at your conduct on this dignified
      occasion. I am also angry with Brian and the rest of you. Did you not
      observe that the decent man was advanced in liquor? I would have told you
      so at once, were it not that he was present while I spoke. Did I not give
      you as strong a hint as possible? Did I not tell you that &lsquo;I spoke
      significantly?&rsquo; Now hear me. Take the first opportunity of being
      reconciled to Owen Connor. Be civil to him; for I assure you he esteems me
      very highly. Be also kind to his daughter, who is an excellent girl; but I
      repeat it, her father esteems me highly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he think highly of you, Denis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have said so,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, throth, we&rsquo;re sorry for what has happened, poor man. But the never
      a one o&rsquo; me, Denis, saw the laste sign of liquor about him. Throth, we
      will make it up wid him, thin. An&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll be kind to his daughter, too,
      Denis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then as a proof that you will follow my advice, I lay it on you as a
      duty, to let me know how they are, whenever you write to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throth, we will, Denis;&mdash;indeed will we. Come in now, dear; this is
      the last night you&rsquo;re to be wid us, an&rsquo; they&rsquo;re all missin! you in the
      house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On that night no person slept in Denis O&rsquo;Shaughnessy&rsquo;s, except our hero,
      and his mother and sisters. As morning approached a heaviness of spirits
      prevailed among the family, which of course was not felt by any except his
      immediate relations. The more distant friends, who remained with them for
      the night, sang and plied the bottle with a steadiness which prevented
      them from feeling the want of rest. About six o&rsquo;clock, breakfast was
      ready, Denis dressed, and every arrangement made for his immediate
      departure. His parents&mdash;his brothers, and his sisters were all in
      tears, and he himself could master his emotions with great difficulty. At
      length the hour to which the family of our candidate had long looked
      forward, arrived, and Denis rose to depart for Maynooth. Except by the
      sobs and weeping, the silence was unbroken when he stood up to bid them
      farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first he embraced was his eldest brother, Brian: &ldquo;Brian,&rdquo; said he, but
      he could not proceed&mdash;his voice failed him: he then extended his
      hand, but Brian clasped him in tis arms&mdash;kissed his beloved brother,
      and wept with strong grief; even then there was not a dry eye in the
      house. The parting with his other brothers was equally tender&mdash;they
      wept loudly and bitterly, and Denis joined in their grief. Then came his
      sisters, who, one by one, hung upon him, and sobbed as if he had been
      dead. The grief of his youngest sister, Susan, was excessive. She threw
      her arms about his neck, and said she would not let him go; Denis pressed
      her to his heart, and the grief which he felt, seemed to penetrate his
      very soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Susan,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Susan, may the blessing of God rest upon you till I see
      you again!&rdquo;&mdash;and the affectionate girl was literally torn from his
      arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how came the most affecting part of the ceremony. His parents had
      stood apart&mdash;their hands locked in each other, both in tears, whilst
      he took leave of the rest. He now approached his mother, and reverently
      kneeling down, implored in words scarcely intelligible, her blessing and
      forgiveness; he extended both his hands&mdash;&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I ask&mdash;humbly
      and penitently, I ask your blessing; it will be sweet to me from your
      beloved lips, dear mother;&mdash;pardon me if I ever&mdash;as I feel I
      often did&mdash;caused you a pang of sorrow by my disobedience and folly.
      Oh, pardon me&mdash;pardon me for all now! Bless your son, kindest of
      mothers, with your best and tenderest blessing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She threw herself in his arms, and locking him in her embrace, imprinted
      every part of his face with kisses. &ldquo;Oh, Denis,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;there is
      but one more who will miss you more nor I will&mdash;Oh, my darlin&rsquo; son&mdash;our
      pride&mdash;our pride&mdash;our heart&rsquo;s pride&mdash;our honor, and our
      credit! Sure, <i>anim machree</i>, I have nothin&rsquo; to forgive you for, my
      heart&rsquo;s life; but may the blessin&rsquo; of God and of a happy mother light on
      you! And, Denis <i>asthore</i>, wasn&rsquo;t it you that made me happy, and that
      made us all happy. May my blessin&rsquo; and the blessin&rsquo; of God rest upon you&mdash;keep
      you from every evil, and in every good, till my eyes will be made glad by
      lookin&rsquo; on you agin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A grief more deep, and a happiness more full, than had yet been felt, were
      now to come forth. Denis turned to his father&mdash;his companion in many
      a pastime, and in many a walk about their native fields. In fair&mdash;in
      market&mdash;at mass&mdash;and at every rustic amusement within their
      reach&mdash;had he been ever at the side of that indulgent father, whose
      heart and soul were placed in him. Denis could not utter a word, but kept
      his streaming eyes fixed upon the old man, with that yearning expression
      of the heart which is felt when it desires to be mingled with the very
      existence of the object that it loves. Old Denis advanced, under powerful
      struggles, to suppress his grief; he knelt, and, as the tears ran in
      silence down his cheeks, thus addressed himself to God:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I kneel down before you, oh, my God a poor sinner! I kneel here in your
      blessed presence, with a heart&mdash;with a happy heartens day, to return
      you thanks in the name of myself and the beloved partner you have given me
      through the cares and thrials of this world, to give you our heart&rsquo;s best
      thanks for graciously permittin&rsquo; us to see this day! It is to you we owe
      it, good Father of Heaven! It is to you we owe this&mdash;an&rsquo; him&mdash;my
      heart&rsquo;s own son, that kneels before me to be blessed by my lips! Yes&mdash;yes,
      he is&mdash;he is the pride of our lives!&mdash;He is the mornin&rsquo; star
      among us! he was ever a good son; and you know that from the day he was
      born to this minute, he never gave me a sore heart! Take him under your
      own protection! Oh, bless him as we wish, if it be your holy will to do
      so!&mdash;Bless him and guard him, for my heart&rsquo;s in him: it is&mdash;he
      knows it&mdash;everybody knows it;&mdash;and if anything was to happen him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could proceed no further: the idea of losing his son, even in
      imagination, overpowered him;&mdash;he rose, locked him to his breast, and
      for many minutes the grief of both was loud and vehement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denis&rsquo;s uncle now interposed: &ldquo;The horses,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are at the door, an&rsquo; 
      time&rsquo;s passin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Och, thrue for you, Barny,&rdquo; said old Denis; &ldquo;come, <i>acushla</i>, an&rsquo; 
      let me help you on your horse. We will go on quickly, as we&rsquo;re to meet
      Father Finnerty at the crass-roads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis then shook hands with them all, not forgetting honest Phadrick
      Murray, who exclaimed, as he bid him farewell, &ldquo;Arrah! Misther Denis,
      aroon, won&rsquo;t you be thinkin&rsquo; of me now an&rsquo; thin in the College? Faix, if
      you always argue as bravely wid the Collegians as you did the day you
      proved me to be an ass you&rsquo;ll soon be at the head of them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Denis,&rdquo; said the uncle, &ldquo;your father excuses me in regard of havin&rsquo; to
      attend my cattle in the fair to-day. You won&rsquo;t be angry wid me, dear, for
      lavin&rsquo; you now, as my road lies this other way. May the blessin&rsquo; of God
      and his holy mother keep you till I see you agin! an&rsquo;, Denis, if you&rsquo;d
      send me a scrape or two, lettin&rsquo; me know what a good parish &lsquo;ud be worth;
      for I intend next spring to go wid little Barny to the Latin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This Denis promised to do; and after bidding him farewell, he and his
      friends&mdash;some on horseback and numbers on foot&mdash;set out on their
      journey; and as they proceeded through their own neighborhood, many a
      crowd was collected to get a sight of Denis O&rsquo;Shaughnessy going to
      Maynooth.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      It was one day in autumn, after a lapse of about two years, that the
      following conversation took place between a wealthy grazier from the
      neighboring parish, and one of our hero&rsquo;s most intimate, acquaintances. It
      is valuable only as it throws light upon Denis&rsquo;s ultimate situation in
      life, which, after all, was not what our readers might be inclined to
      expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, honest man,&rdquo; said Denis&rsquo;s friend, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a murdherin&rsquo; fine
      dhrove o&rsquo; bullocks you&rsquo;re bringin&rsquo; to the fair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; replied the grazier, &ldquo;you may say that. I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; it wouldn&rsquo;t be
      asay to aquil them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix, sure enough. Where wor they fed, wid simmission?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up in Teernahusshogue. Arrah, will you tell me what weddin&rsquo; was that that
      passed awhile agone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A son of ould Denis O&rsquo;Shaughnessy&rsquo;s, God be merciful to his sowl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Denis O&rsquo;Shaughnessy! Is it him they called the &lsquo;Pigeon-house?&rsquo; An&rsquo; is it
      possible he&rsquo;s dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead, nabor, an&rsquo; in throth, an honest man&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As ever broke the world&rsquo;s bread. The Lord make his bed in heaven this
      day! Hasn&rsquo;t he a son larnin&rsquo; to be a priest in May-newth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! <i>Fahreer gairh!</i> That&rsquo;s all over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, is he dead, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be Gorra, no&mdash;but the conthrairy to that. &lsquo;Twas his weddin&rsquo; you seen
      passin&rsquo; a minute agone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it the young sogarth&rsquo;s? Musha, bad end to you, man alive, an&rsquo; spake
      out. Tell us how that happened. Sowl it&rsquo;s a quare business, an&rsquo; him was in
      Maynewth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, he was so; an&rsquo; they say there wasn&rsquo;t a man in Maynewth able to
      tache him. But, passin&rsquo; that over&mdash;you see, the father, ould Denis&mdash;an&rsquo; 
      be Gorra, he was very bright, too, till the son grewn up, an&rsquo; drownded him
      wid the languidges&mdash;the father, you see, ould Denis himself, tuck a
      faver whin the son was near a year in the college, an&rsquo; it proved too many
      for him. He died; an&rsquo; whin young Dinny hard of it, the divil a one of him
      would stay any longer in Maynewth. He came home like a scarecrow, said he
      lost his health in it, an&rsquo; refused to go back. Faith, it was a lucky thing
      that his father died beforehand, for it would brake his heart. As it was,
      they had terrible work about it. But ould Denis is never dead while young
      Denis is livin&rsquo;. Faix, he was as stiff as they wor stout, an&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t
      give in; so, afther ever so much&rsquo; wranglin&rsquo;, he got the upper hand by
      tellin&rsquo; them that he wasn&rsquo;t able to bear the college at all; an&rsquo; that if
      he&rsquo;d go back to it he&rsquo;d soon folly his father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; what turned him against the college? Was that thrue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thrue!&mdash;thrue indeed! The same youth was never at a loss for a piece
      of invintion whin it sarved him. No, the sarra word of thruth at all was
      in it. He soodered an&rsquo; palavered a daughther of Owen Connor&rsquo;s, Susy&mdash;all
      the daughther he has, indeed&mdash;before he wint to Maynewth at all, they
      say. She herself wasn&rsquo;t for marryin&rsquo; him, in regard of a vow she had; but
      there&rsquo;s no doubt but he made her fond of him, for he has a tongue that &lsquo;ud
      make black white, or white black, for that matther. So, be Gorra, he got
      the vow taken off of her by the Bishop; she soon recovered her health, for
      she was dyin&rsquo; for love of him, an&rsquo;&mdash;you seen their weddin&rsquo;. It &lsquo;ud be
      worth your while to go a day&rsquo;s journey to get a sight of her&mdash;she&rsquo;s
      allowed to be the purtiest girl that ever was in this part o&rsquo; the
      counthry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! well! It&rsquo;s a quare world. An&rsquo; is the family all agreeable to it
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hut! where was the use of houldin&rsquo; out aginst him? I tell you, he&rsquo;d make
      them agreeable to any thing, wanst he tuck it into his head. Indeed, it&rsquo;s
      he that has the great larnin&rsquo; all out! Why, now, you&rsquo;d hardly b&rsquo;lieve me,
      when I tell you that he&rsquo;d prove you to be an ass in three minutes; make it
      as plain as the sun. He would; an&rsquo; often made an ass o&rsquo; myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, now that I look at you&mdash;aren&rsquo;t you Dan Murray&rsquo;s nephew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phadrick Murray, an&rsquo; divil a one else, sure enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is your family, Phadrick? Why, man, you don&rsquo;t know your friends&mdash;my
      name&rsquo;s Cahill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it Andy Cahill of Phuldhu? Why, thin, death alive, Andy, how is every
      bit of you? Andy, I&rsquo;m regulatin&rsquo; everything at this weddin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; you must
      turn over your horse till we have a dhrop for ould times. Bless my sowl!
      sure, I&rsquo;d know your brother round a corner; an&rsquo; yourself, too, I ought to
      know, only that I didn&rsquo;t see you since you wor a slip of a gorsoon. Come
      away, man, sure thim men o&rsquo; yours can take care o&rsquo; the cattle. You&rsquo;ll
      asily overtake thim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throth, I don&rsquo;t care if I have a glass wid an ould friend. But, I hope
      your whiskey won&rsquo;t overtake me, Phadrick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The never a fear of it, your father&rsquo;s son has too good a head for that.
      Ough! man alive, if you could stay for the weddin&rsquo;! Divil a sich a let out
      ever was seen in the county widin the mimory of the ouldest man in it, as
      it&rsquo;ll be. Denis is the boy that &lsquo;ud have the dacent thing or nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The grazier and Phadrick Murray then bent their steps to Owen Connor&rsquo;s
      house, where the wedding was held. It is unnecessary to say that Phadrick
      plied his new acquaintance to some purpose. Ere two hours passed the
      latter had forgotten his bullocks as completely as if he had never seen
      them, and his drovers were left to their own discretion in effecting their
      sale. As for Andy Cahill, like many another sapient Irishman, he preferred
      his pleasure to his business, got drunk, and danced, and sung at Denis
      O&rsquo;Shaughnessy&rsquo;s wedding, which we are bound to say was the longest, the
      most hospitable, and most frolicsome that ever has been remembered in the
      parish from that day to the present.

&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
