      PHIL PURCEL, THE PIG-DRIVER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Phil Purcel was a singular character, for he was never married; but
      notwithstanding his singularity, no man ever possessed, for practical
      purposes, a more plentiful stock of duplicity. All his acquaintances knew
      that Phil was a knave of the first water, yet was he decidedly a general
      favorite. Now as we hate mystery ourselves, we shall reveal the secret of
      this remarkable popularity; though, after all, it can scarcely be called
      so, for Phil was not the first cheat who has been popular in his day. The
      cause of his success lay simply in this; that he never laughed; and, none
      of our readers need be told, that the appearance of a grave cheat in
      Ireland is an originality which almost runs up into a miracle. This
      gravity induced every one to look upon him as a phenomenon. The assumed
      simplicity of his manners was astonishing, and the ignorance which he
      feigned, so apparently natural, that it was scarcely possible for the most
      keen-sighted searcher into human motives to detect him. The only way of
      understanding the man was to deal with him: if, after that, you did not
      comprehend him thoroughly, the fault was not Phil&rsquo;s, but your own.
      Although not mirthful himself, he was the cause of mirth in others; for,
      without ever smiling at his own gains, he contrived to make others laugh
      at their losses. His disposition, setting aside laughter, was strictly
      anomalous. The most incompatible, the most unamalgamatible, and the most
      uncomeatable qualities that ever refused to unite in the same individual,
      had no scruple at all to unite in Phil. But we hate metaphysics, which we
      leave to the mechanical philosophers, and proceed to state that Phil was a
      miser, which is the best explanation we can give of his gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ireland, owing to the march of intellect, and the superiority of modern
      refinement, has been for some years past, and is at present, well supplied
      with an abundant variety of professional men, every one of whom will
      undertake, for proper considerations, to teach us Irish all manner of
      useful accomplishments. The drawing-master talks of his profession; the
      dancing-master of his profession; the fiddler, tooth-drawer, and
      corn-cutter (who by the way, reaps a richer harvest than we do), since the
      devil has tempted the schoolmaster to go abroad, are all practising in his
      absence, as professional men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now-Phil must be included among this class of grandiloquent gentlemen, for
      he entered life as a Professor of Pig-driving; and it is but justice
      towards him to assert, that no corn-cutter of them all ever elevated his
      profession so high as Phil did that in which he practised. In fact, he
      raised it to the most exalted pitch of improvement of which it was then
      susceptible; or to use the cant of the day, he soon arrived at &ldquo;the head
      of his profession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In Phil&rsquo;s time, however, pig-driving was not so general, nor had it made
      such rapid advances as in modern times. It was, then, simply, pig-driving,
      unaccompanied by the improvements of poverty, sickness, and famine.
      Political economy had not then taught the people how to be poor upon the
      most scientific principles; free trade had not shown the nation the most
      approved plan of reducing itself to the lowest possible state of distress;
      nor liberalism enabled the working classes to scoff at religion, and
      wisely to stop at the very line that lies between outrage and rebellion.
      Many errors and inconveniences, now happily exploded, were then in
      existence. The people, it is true, were somewhat attached to their
      landlords, but still they were burdened with the unnecessary appendages of
      good coats and stout shoes; were tolerably industrious, and had the
      mortification of being able to pay their rents, and feed in comfort. They
      were not, as they are now, free from new coats and old prejudices, nor
      improved by the intellectual march of politics and poverty. When either a
      man or a nation starves, it is a luxury to starve in an enlightened
      manner; and nothing is more consolatory to a person acquainted with public
      rights and constitutional privileges, than to understand those liberal
      principles upon which he fasts and goes naked.
    </p>
    <p>
      From all we have said, the reader sees clearly that pig-driving did not
      then proceed upon so extensive a scale as it does at present. The people,
      in fact, killed many of them for their own use; and we know not how it
      happened, but political ignorance and good bacon kept them in more flesh
      and comfort than those theories which have since succeeded so well in
      introducing the science of starvation as the basis of national prosperity.
      Irishmen are frequently taxed with extravagance, in addition to their
      other taxes; but we should be glad to know what people in Europe reduce
      economy in the articles of food and clothing to such close practice as
      they do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be this as it may, there was, in Ireland, an old breed of swine, which is
      now nearly extinct, except in some remote parts of the country, where they
      are still useful in the hunting season, particularly if dogs happen to be
      scarce.* They were a tall, loose species, with legs of an unusual length,
      with no flesh, short ears, as if they had been cropped for sedition, and
      with long faces of a highly intellectual cast. They were also of such
      activity that few greyhounds could clear a ditch or cross a field with
      more agility or speed. Their backs formed a rainbow arch, capable of being
      contracted or extended to an inconceivable degree; and their usual rate of
      travelling in droves was at mail-coach speed, or eight Irish miles an
      hour, preceded by an outrider to clear the way, whilst their rear was
      brought up by another horseman, going at a three-quarter gallop.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * We assure John Bull, on the authority of Purcel
     himself, that this is a fact.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the middle of summer, when all nature reposed under the united
      influence of heat and dust, it was an interesting sight to witness a drove
      of them sweeping past, like a whirlwind, in a cloud of their own raising;
      their sharp and lengthy outlines dimly visible through the shining haze,
      like a flock of antelopes crossing the deserts of the East.
    </p>
    <p>
      But alas! for those happy days! This breed is now a curiosity&mdash;few
      specimens of it remaining except in the mountainous parts of the country,
      whither these lovers of liberty, like the free natives of the back
      settlements of America, have retired to avoid the encroachments of
      civilization, and exhibit their Irish antipathy to the slavish comforts of
      steamboat navigation, and the relaxing luxuries of English feeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, their patriotism, as evinced in an attachment to Ireland and Irish
      habits, was scarcely more remarkable than their sagacity. There is not an
      antiquary among the members of that learned and useful body, the Irish
      Academy, who can boast such an intimate knowledge of the Irish language in
      all its shades of meaning and idiomatic beauty, as did this once
      flourishing class of animals. Nor were they confined to the Irish tongue
      alone, many of them understood English too; and it was said of those that
      belonged to a convent, the members of which, in their intercourse with
      each other, spoke only in Latin, that they were tolerable masters of that
      language, and refused to leave a potato field or plot of cabbages, except
      when addressed in it. To the English tongue, however, they had a
      deep-rooted antipathy; whether it proceeded from the national feeling, or
      the fact of its not being sufficiently guttural, I cannot say; but be this
      as it may, it must be admitted that they were excellent Irish scholars,
      and paid a surprising degree of deference and obedience to whatever was
      addressed to them in their own language. In Munster, too, such of them as
      belonged to the hedge-schoolmasters were good proficients in Latin; but it
      is on a critical knowledge of their native tongue that I take my stand. On
      this point they were unrivalled by the most learned pigs or antiquaries of
      their day; none of either class possessing, at that period, such a
      knowledge of Irish manners, nor so keen a sagacity in tracing out Irish
      roots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their education, it is true, was not neglected, and their instructors had
      the satisfaction of seeing that it was not lost. Nothing could present a
      finer display of true friendship founded upon a sense of equality, mutual
      interest, and good-will, than the Irishman and his pig. The Arabian and
      his horse are proverbial; but had our English neighbors known as much of
      Ireland as they did of Arabia, they would have found as signal instances
      of attachment subsisting between the former as between the latter; and,
      perhaps, when the superior comforts of an Arabian hut are contrasted with
      the squalid poverty of an Irish cabin, they would have perceived a heroism
      and a disinterestedness evinced by the Irish parties, that would have
      struck them with greater admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pigs, however, of the present day are a fat, gross, and degenerate
      breed; and more like well-fed aldermen, than Irish pigs of the old school.
      They are, in fact, a proud, lazy, carnal race, entirely of the earth,
      earthy. John Bull assures us it is one comfort, however, that we do not
      eat, but ship them out of the country; yet, after all, with, great respect
      to John, it is not surprising that we should repine a little on thinking
      of the good old times of sixty years since, when every Irishman could kill
      his own pig, and eat it when he pleased. We question much whether any
      measure that might make the eating of meat compulsory upon us, would
      experience from Irishmen a very decided opposition. But it is very
      condescending in John to eat our beef and mutton; and as he happens to
      want both, it is particularly disinterested in him to encourage us in the
      practice of self-denial. It is possible, however, that we may ultimately
      refuse to banquet by proxy on our own provisions; and that John may not be
      much longer troubled to eat for us in that capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The education of an Irish pig, at the time of which we write, was an
      important consideration to an Irishman. He, and his family, and his pig,
      like the Arabian and his horse, all slept in the same bed; the pig
      generally, for the sake of convenience, next the &ldquo;stock&rdquo; (* at the
      outside). At meals the pig usually was stationed at the <i>serahag</i>, or
      potato-basket; where the only instances of bad temper he ever displayed
      broke out in petty and unbecoming squabbles with the younger branches of
      the family. Indeed, if he ever descended from his high station as a member
      of the domestic circle, it was upon these occasions, when, with a want of
      dignity, accounted for only by the grovelling motive of self-interest, he
      embroiled himself in a series of miserable feuds and contentions about
      scraping the pot, or carrying off from the jealous urchins about him more
      than came to his share. In these heart-burnings about the good things of
      this world, he was treated with uncommon forbearance: in his owner he
      always had a friend, from whom, when he grunted out his appeal to him, he
      was certain of receiving redress: &ldquo;Barney, behave, avick: lay down the
      potstick, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t be batin&rsquo; the pig, the crathur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the pig was never mentioned but with this endearing epithet of
      &ldquo;crathur&rdquo; annexed. &ldquo;Barney, go an&rsquo; call home the pig, the crathur, to his
      dinner, before it gets cowld an him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Barney, go an&rsquo; see if you can see
      the pig, the crathur, his buckwhist will soon be ready.&rdquo; &ldquo;Barney, run an&rsquo; 
      dhrive the pig, the crathur, out of Larry Neil&rsquo;s phatie-field: an&rsquo;,
      Barney, whisper, a bouchal bawn, don&rsquo;t run <i>too</i> hard, Barney, for
      fraid you&rsquo;d lose your breath. What if the crathur does get a taste o&rsquo; the
      new phaties&mdash;small blame to him for the same!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In short, whatever might have been the habits of the family, such were
      those of the pig. The latter was usually out early in the morning to take
      exercise, and the unerring regularity with which he returned at mealtime
      gave sufficient proof that procuring an appetite was a work of
      supererogation on his part. If he came before the meal was prepared, his
      station was at the door, which they usually shut to keep him out of the
      way until it should be ready. In the meantime, so far as a forenoon
      serenade and an indifferent voice could go, his powers of melody were
      freely exercised on the outside. But he did not stop here: every stretch
      of ingenuity was tried by which a possibility of gaining admittance could
      be established. The hat and rags were repeatedly driven in from the
      windows, which from practice and habit he was enabled to approach on his
      hind legs; a cavity was also worn by the frequent grubbings of his snout
      under the door, the lower part of which was broken away by the sheer
      strength of his tusks, so that he was enabled, by thrusting himself
      between the bottom of it and the ground, to make a most unexpected
      appearance on the hearth, before his presence was at all convenient or
      acceptable.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, independently of these two modes of entrance, i. e., the door and
      window, there was also a third, by which he sometimes scrupled not to make
      a descent upon the family. This was by the chimney. There are many of the
      Irish cabins built for economy&rsquo;s sake against slopes in the ground, so
      that the labor of erecting either a gable or side-wall is saved by the
      perpendicular bank that remains after the site of the house is scooped
      away. Of the facilities presented by this peculiar structure, the pig
      never failed to avail himself. He immediately mounted the roof (through
      which, however, he sometimes took an unexpected flight), and traversing it
      with caution, reached the chimney, into which he deliberately backed
      himself, and with no small share of courage, went down precisely as the
      northern bears are said to descend the trunks of trees during the winter,
      but with far different motives.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this manner he cautiously retrograded downwards with a hardihood, which
      set furze bushes, brooms, tongs, and all other available weapons of the
      cabin at defiance. We are bound, however, to declare, that this mode of
      entrance, which was only resorted to when every other failed, was usually
      received by the cottager and his family with a degree of mirth and
      good-humor that were not lost upon the sagacity of the pig. In order to
      save him from being scorched, which he deserved for his temerity, they
      usually received him in a creel, often in a quilt, and sometimes in the
      tattered blanket, or large pot, out of which he looked with a humorous
      conception of his own enterprise, that was highly diverting. We must
      admit, however, that he was sometimes received with the comforts of a hot
      poker, which Paddy pleasantly called, &ldquo;givin&rsquo; him a warm welcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another trait in the character of these animals, was the utter scorn with
      which they treated all attempts to fatten them. In fact, the usual
      consequences of good feeding were almost inverted in their case; and
      although I might assert that they became leaner in proportion to what they
      received, yet I must confine myself to truth, by stating candidly that
      this was not the fact; that there was a certain state of fleshlessness to
      which they arrived, but from which they neither advanced nor receded by
      good feeding or bad. At this point, despite of all human ingenuity, they
      remained stationary for life, received the bounty afforded them with a
      greatness of appetite resembling the fortitude of a brave man, which rises
      in energy according to the magnitude of that which it has to encounter.
      The truth is, they were scandalous hypocrites; for with the most
      prodigious capacity for food, they were spare as philosophers, and fitted
      evidently more for the chase than the sty; rather to run down a buck or a
      hare for the larder, than to have a place in it themselves. If you starved
      them, they defied you to diminish their flesh; and if you stuffed them
      like aldermen, they took all they got, but disdained to carry a single
      ounce more than if you gave them whey thickened with water. In short, they
      gloried in maceration and liberty; were good Irish scholars, sometimes
      acquainted with Latin; and their flesh, after the trouble of separating it
      from a superfluity of tough skin, was excellent venison so far as it went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Phil Purcel, whom we will introduce more intimately to the reader by
      and by, was the son of a man who always kept a pig.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father&rsquo;s house had a small loft, to which the ascent was by a
      step-ladder through a door in the inside gable. The first good thing ever
      Phil was noticed for he said upon the following occasion. His father
      happened to be called upon, one morning before breakfast, by his landlord,
      who it seems occasionally visited his tenantry to encourage, direct,
      stimulate, or reprove them, as the case might require. Phil was a boy
      then, and sat on the hob in the corner, eyeing the landlord and his father
      during their conversation. In the mean time the pig came in, and
      deliberately began to ascend the ladder with an air of authority that
      marked him as one in the exercise of an established right. The landlord
      was astonished at seeing the animal enter the best room in the house and
      could not help expressing his surprise to old Purcel:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Purcel, is your pig in the habit of treating himself to the comforts
      of your best room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pig is it, the crathur? Why, your haner,&rdquo; said Purcel, after a little
      hesitation, &ldquo;it sometimes goes up of a mornin&rsquo; to waken the childhre,
      particularly when the buckwhist happens to be late. It doesn&rsquo;t like to be
      waitin&rsquo;; and sure none of us likes to be kept from the male&rsquo;s mate, your
      haner, when we want it, no more than it, the crathur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I wonder your wife permits so filthy an animal to have access to her
      rooms in this manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Filthy!&rdquo; replied Mrs. Purcel, who felt herself called upon to defend the
      character of the pig, as well as her own, &ldquo;why, one would think, sir, that
      any crathur that&rsquo;s among Christyen childhre, like one o&rsquo; themselves,
      couldn&rsquo;t be filthy. I could take it to my dyin&rsquo; day, that there&rsquo;s not a
      claner or dacenter pig in the kingdom, than the same pig. It never
      misbehaves, the crathur, but goes out, as wise an&rsquo; riglar, jist by a look,
      an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s enough for it, any day&mdash;a single look, your haner, the
      poor crathur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; observed Phil, from the hob, &ldquo;that nobody has a betther right
      to the run of the house, whedher up stairs or down stairs, <i>than him
      that pays the rint</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well said, my lad!&rdquo; observed the landlord, laughing at the quaint
      ingenuity of Phil&rsquo;s defence. &ldquo;His payment of the rent is the best defence
      possible, and no doubt should cover a multitude of his errors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A multitude of his shins, you mane, sir,&rdquo; said Phil, &ldquo;for thruth he&rsquo;s all
      shin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In fact, Phil from his infancy had an uncommon attachment to these
      animals, and by a mind naturally shrewd and observing, made himself as
      intimately acquainted with their habits and instincts, and the best modes
      of managing them, as ever the celebrated <i>Cahir na Cappul</i>* did with
      those of the horse. Before he was fifteen, he could drive the most vicious
      and obstinate pig as quietly before him as a lamb; yet no one knew how,
      nor by what means he had gained the secret that enabled him to do it.
      Whenever he attended a fair, his time was principally spent among the
      pigs, where he stood handling, and examining, and pretending to buy them,
      although he seldom had half-a-crown in his pocket. At length, by hoarding
      up such small sums as he could possibly lay his hand on, he got together
      the price of a &ldquo;slip,&rdquo; which he bought, reared, and educated in a manner
      that did his ingenuity great credit. When this was brought to its <i>ne
      plus ultra</i> of fatness, he sold it, and purchased two more, which he
      fed in the same way. On disposing of these, he made a fresh purchase, and
      thus proceeded, until, in the course of a few years, he was a well-known
      pig-jobber.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * I subjoin from Townsend&rsquo;s Survey of the county of
     Cork a short but authentic account of this most
     extraordinary character:&mdash;&ldquo;James Sullivan was a native
     of the county of Cork, and an awkward ignorant rustic
     of the lowest class, generally known by the appellation
     of the <i>Whisperer</i>, and his profession was horse-
     breaking. The credulity of the vulgar bestowed that
     epithet upon him, from an opinion that he communicated
     his wishes to the animal by means of a whisper; and the
     singularity of his method gave some color to the
     superstitious belief. As far as the sphere of his
     control extended, the boast of <i>Veni, Vidi, Vici</i>, was
     more justly claimed by James Sullivan, than by Caesar,
     or even Bonaparte himself. How his art was acquired, or
     in what it consisted, is likely to remain for ever
     unknown, as he has lately left the world without
     divulging it. His son, who follows the same occupation,
     possesses but a small portion of the art, having either
     never learned its true secret, or being incapable of
     putting it in practice. The wonder of his skill
     consisted in the short time requisite to accomplish his
     design, which was performed in private, and without any
     apparent means of coercion. Every description of horse,
     or even mule, whether previously broke, or unhandled,
     whatever their peculiar vices or ill habits might have
     been, submitted, without show of resistance, to the
     magical influence of his art, and, in the short space
     of half an hour, became gentle and tractable. The
     effect, though instantaneously produced, was generally
     durable. Though more submissive to him than to others,
     yet they seemed to have acquired a docility, unknown
     before. When sent for to tame a vicious horse, he
     directed the stable in which he and the object of his
     experiment were placed, to be shut, with orders not to
     open the door until a signal given. After a <i>tete-a-
     tete</i> between him and the horse for about half an hour,
     during which little or no bustle was heard, the signal
     was made; and upon opening the door, the horse was
     seen, lying down, and the man by his side, playing
     familiarly with him, like a child with a puppy dog.
     From that time he was found perfectly willing to submit
     to discipline, however repugnant to his nature before.
     Some saw his skill tried on a horse, which could never
     be brought to stand for a smith to shoe him. The day
     after Sullivan&rsquo;s half hour lecture, I went, not without
     some incredulity, to the smith&rsquo;s shop, with many other
     curious spectators, where we were eye-witnesses of the
     complete success of his art. This, too, had been a
     troop-horse; and it was supposed, not without reason,
     that after regimental discipline had failed, no other
     would be found availing. I observed that the animal
     seemed afraid, whenever Sullivan either spoke or looked
     at him. How that extraordinary ascendancy could have
     been obtained, it is difficult to conjecture, in common
     eases, this mysterious preparation was unnecessary. He
     seemed to possess an instinctive power of inspiring
     awe, the result, perhaps, of natural intrepidity, in
     which, I believe, a great part of his art consisted;
     though the circumstance of his tete-a-tete shows, that,
     upon particular occasions, something more must have
     been added to it. A faculty like this would, in other
     hands, have made a fortune, and great offers have been
     made to him for the exercise of his art abroad; but
     hunting, and attachment to his native soil, were his
     ruling passions. He lived at home, in the style most
     agreeable to his disposition, and nothing could induce
     him to quit Dunhalow and the fox-hounds.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Phil&rsquo;s journeys as a pig-driver to the leading seaport towns nearest him,
      were always particularly profitable. In Ireland, swine are not kept in
      sties, as they are among English feeders, but permitted, to go at liberty
      through pasture fields, commons, and along roadsides, where they make up
      as well as they can for the scanty pittance allowed them at home during
      meal-times. We do not, however, impeach Phil&rsquo;s honesty; but simply content
      ourselves with saying, that when his journey was accomplished, he mostly
      found the original number with which he had set out increased by three or
      four, and sometimes by half a dozen. Pigs in general resemble each other,
      and it surely was not Phil&rsquo;s fault if a stray one, feeding on the roadside
      or common, thought proper to join his drove and see the world. Phil&rsquo;s
      object, we presume, was only to take care that his original number was not
      diminished, its increase being a matter in which he felt little concern.
      He now determined to take a professional trip to England, and that this
      might be the more productive, he resolved to purchase a lot of the animals
      we have been describing. No time was lost in this speculation. The pigs
      were bought up as cheaply as possible, and Phil sat out, for the first
      time in his life, to try with what success he could measure his skill
      against that of a Yorkshireman. On this occasion, he brought with him a
      pet, which he had with considerable pains trained up for purposes
      hereafter to be explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing remarkable in the passage, unless that every creature on
      board was sea-sick, except the pigs; even to them, however, the change was
      a disagreeable one; for to be pent up in the hold of a ship was a
      deprivation of liberty, which, fresh as they were from their native hills,
      they could not relish. They felt, therefore, as patriots, a loss of
      freedom, but not a whit of appetite; for, in truth, of the latter no
      possible vicissitude short of death could deprive them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phil, however, with an assumed air of simplicity absolutely stupid,
      disposed of them to a Yorkshire dealer at about twice the value they would
      have brought in Ireland, though as pigs went in England it was low enough.
      He declared that they had been fed on tip-top feeding: which was literally
      true, as he afterwards admitted that the tops of nettles and potato stalks
      constituted the only nourishment they had got for three weeks before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Yorkshireman looked with great contempt upon what he considered a
      miserable essay to take him in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a fule this Hirishmun mun bea;&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to think to teake me in!
      Had he said that them there Hirish swoine were badly feade, I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; 
      thought it fairish enough on un; but to seay that they was oll weal feade
      on tip-top feeadin&rsquo;! Nea, nea! I knaws weal enough that they was noat
      feade on nothin&rsquo; at oll, which meakes them loak so poorish! Howsomever, I
      shall fatten them. I&rsquo;se warrant&mdash;I&rsquo;se warrant I shall!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When driven home to sties somewhat more comfortable than the cabins of
      unfortunate Irishmen, they were well supplied with food which would have
      been very often considered a luxury by poor Paddy himself, much less by
      his pigs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Measter,&rdquo; said the man who had seen them fed, &ldquo;them there Hirish pigs ha&rsquo; 
      not feasted nout for a moonth yet: they feade like nout I seed o&rsquo; my
      laife!!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay! ay!&rdquo; replied the master, &ldquo;I&rsquo;se warrant they&rsquo;ll soon fatten&mdash;I&rsquo;se
      warrant they shall, Hodge&mdash;they be praime feeders&mdash;I&rsquo;se warrant
      they shall; and then, Hodge, we&rsquo;ve bit the soft Hirishmun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hodge gave a knowing look at his master, and grinned at this observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Hodge repaired to the sties to see how they were
      thriving; when, to his great consternation, he found the feeding-troughs
      clean as if they had been washed, and, not a single Irish pig to be seen
      or heard about the premises; but to what retreat the animals could have
      betaken themselves, was completely beyond his comprehension. He scratched
      his head, and looked about him in much perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dang un!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I never seed nout like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would have proceeded in a strain of cogitation equally enlightened, had
      not a noise of shouting, alarm, and confusion in the neighborhood, excited
      his attention. He looked about him, and to his utter astonishment saw that
      some extraordinary commotion prevailed, that the country was up, and the
      hills alive with people, who ran, and shouted, and wheeled at full flight
      in all possible directions. His first object was to join the crowd, which
      he did as soon as possible, and found that the pigs he had shut up the
      preceding night in sties whose enclosures were at least four feet high,
      had cleared them like so many chamois, and were now closely pursued by the
      neighbors, who rose <i>en masse</i> to hunt down and secure such dreadful
      depredators.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waste and mischief they had committed in one night were absolutely
      astonishing. Bean and turnip fields, and vegetable enclosures of all
      descriptions, kitchen-gardens, corn-fields, and even flower-gardens, were
      rooted up and destroyed with an appearance of system which would have done
      credit to Terry Alt himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their speed was the theme of every tongue. Hedges were taken in their
      flight, and cleared in a style that occasioned the country people to turn
      up their eyes, and scratch their heads in wonder. Dogs of all degrees bit
      the dust, and were caught up dead in stupid amazement by their owners, who
      began to doubt whether or not these extraordinary animals were swine at
      all. The depredators in the meantime had adopted the Horatian style of
      battle. Whenever there was an ungenerous advantage taken in the pursuit,
      by slipping dogs across or before their path, they shot off, at a tangent
      through the next crowd; many of whom they prostrated in their flight; by
      this means they escaped the dogs until the latter were somewhat exhausted,
      when, on finding one in advance of the rest, they turned, and, with
      standing bristles and burning tusks, fatally checked their pursuer in his
      full career. To wheel and fly until another got in advance, was then the
      plan of fight; but, in fact the conflict was conducted on the part of the
      Irish pigs with a fertility of expediency that did credit to their
      country, and established for those who displayed it, the possession of
      intellect far superior to that of their opponents. The pigs now began to
      direct their course towards the sties in which they had been so well fed
      the night before. This being their last flight they radiated towards one
      common centre, with a fierceness and celerity that occasioned the woman
      and children to take shelter within doors. On arriving at the sties, the
      ease with which they shot themselves over the four-feet walls was
      incredible. The farmer had caught the alarm, and just came out in time to
      witness their return; he stood with his hands driven down into the pockets
      of his red, capacious waistcoat, and uttered not a word. When the last of
      them came bounding into the sty, Hodge approached, quite breathless and
      exhausted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, measter,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;these be not Hirish pigs at oll, they be
      Hirish devils; and yau mun ha&rsquo; bought &lsquo;em fra a cunning mon!&rdquo;
     </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hodge,&rdquo; replied his master, &ldquo;I&rsquo;se be bit&mdash;I&rsquo;se heard feather talk
      about un. That breed&rsquo;s true Hirish: but I&rsquo;se try and sell &lsquo;em to Squoire
      Jolly to hunt wi&rsquo; as beagles, for he wants a pack. They do say all the
      swoine that the deevils were put into ha&rsquo; been drawn; but for my peart,
      I&rsquo;se sure that some on un must ha&rsquo; escaped to Hireland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phil during the commotion excited by his knavery in Yorkshire, was
      traversing the country, in order to dispose of his remaining pig; and the
      manner in which he effected his first sale of it was as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      A gentleman was one evening standing with some laborers by the wayside
      when a tattered Irishman, equipped in a pair of white dusty brogues,
      stockings without feet, old patched breeches, a bag slung across his
      shoulder, his coarse shirt lying open about a neck tanned by the sun into
      a reddish yellow, a hat nearly the color of the shoes, and a hay rope tied
      for comfort about his waist; in one hand he also held a straw rope, that
      depended from the hind leg of a pig which he drove before him; in the
      other was a cudgel, by the assistance of which he contrived to limp on
      after it, his two shoulder-blades rising and falling alternately with a
      shrugging motion that indicated great fatigue.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came opposite where the gentleman stood he checked the pig, which
      instinctively commenced feeding upon the grass by the edge of the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Och,&rdquo; said he, wiping his brow with the cuff of his coat, &ldquo;<i>mavrone
      orth a muck</i>,* but I&rsquo;m kilt wit you. Musha, Gad bless yer haner, an&rsquo; 
      maybe ye&rsquo;d buy a slip of a pig fwhrom me, that has my heart bruck, so she
      has, if ever any body&rsquo;s heart was bruck wit the likes of her; an&rsquo; sure so
      there was, no doubt, or I wouldn&rsquo;t be as I am wid her. I&rsquo;ll give her a
      dead bargain, sir; for it&rsquo;s only to get her aff av my hands I&rsquo;m wanting
      plase yer haner&mdash;<i>husth amuck&mdash;husth, a veehone!</i>** Be asy,
      an&rsquo; me in conwersation wid his haner here!&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * My sorrow on you for a pig.

     ** Silence pig! Silence, you pig! Silence, you
     vagabond!
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an Irishman?&rdquo; the gentleman inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, sir, from Connaught, yer haner, an&rsquo; ill sell the crathur dag cheap,
      all out. Asy, you thief!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want the pig, my good fellow,&rdquo; replied the Englishman, without
      evincing curiosity enough to inquire how he came to have such a commodity
      for sale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;d be the darlint in no time wid you, sir; the run o&rsquo; your kitchen &lsquo;ud
      make her up a beauty, your haner, along wit no trouble to the sarvints
      about sweepin&rsquo; it, or any thing. You&rsquo;d only have to lay down the
      potato-basket on the flure, or the misthress, Gad bless her, could do it,
      an&rsquo; not lave a crumblin&rsquo; behind her, besides sleepin, your haner, in the
      carner beyant, if she&rsquo;d take the throuble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sluggish phlegm of the Englisman was stirred up a little by the
      twisted, and somewhat incomprehensible nature of these instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far do you intend to proceed tonight, Paddy?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sarra one o&rsquo; myself knows, plaze yer haner: sure we&rsquo;ve an ould sayin&rsquo; 
      of our own in Ireland beyant&mdash;that he&rsquo;s a wise man can I tell how far
      he&rsquo;ll go, sir, till he comes to his journey&rsquo;s ind. I&rsquo;ll give this crathur
      to you at more nor her value, yer haner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More!&mdash;why the man knows not what he&rsquo;s saying,&rdquo; observed the
      gentleman; &ldquo;less you mean, I suppose, Paddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More or less, sir: you&rsquo;ll get her a bargain; an&rsquo; Gad bless you, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is a commodity which I don&rsquo;t want at present. I am very well
      stocked with pigs, as it is. Try elsewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;d flog the counthry side, sir; an&rsquo; if the misthress herself, sir, &lsquo;ud
      shake the wishp o&rsquo; sthraw fwor her in the kitchen, sir, near the whoire.

     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an extraordinary pig, this, of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no lie fwhor you, sir; she&rsquo;s as clane an&rsquo; dacent a crathur, sir!
      Och, if the same pig &lsquo;ud come into the care o&rsquo; the misthress, Gad bliss

      mishthress, yer haner! Thrath she wouldn&rsquo;t turn the crathur from the
      place, in regard that the tindherness ow the feelin&rsquo; would come ower her&mdash;the
      rale gintlewoman, any way! &lsquo;Tis dag chape you have her at what I said,
      sir; an&rsquo; Gad bliss you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to compel me to purchase it whether I will or no?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thrath, it&rsquo;s whor next to nothin&rsquo; I&rsquo;m giv-in&rsquo; her to you, sir; but sure
      you can make your own price at any thing beyant a pound. <i>Huerish amuck&mdash;sladh
      anish!</i>&mdash;be asy, you crathur, sure you&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; into good
      quarthers, any how&mdash;go into the hanerable English gintleman&rsquo;s
      kitchen, an&rsquo; God knows it&rsquo;s a pleasure to dale wit &lsquo;em. Och, the world&rsquo;s
      differ there is betuxt them, an&rsquo; our own dirty Irish buckeens, that &lsquo;ud
      shkin a bad skilleen, an&rsquo; pay their debts wit the remaindher. The gateman
      &lsquo;ud let me in, yer haner, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll meet you at the big house, abow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my honor this is a good jest,&rdquo; said the gentleman, absolutely teased
      into a compliance; &ldquo;you are forcing me to buy that which I don&rsquo;t want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure you will, sir; you&rsquo;ll want more nor that yit, please Gad, if you be
      spared. Come, amuck&mdash;come, you crathur; faix you&rsquo;re in luck so you
      are&mdash;gettin&rsquo; so good a place wit his haner, here, that you won&rsquo;t know
      yourself shortly, plase God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He immediately commenced driving his pig towards the gentleman&rsquo;s residence
      with such an air of utter simplicity, as would have imposed upon any man
      not guided by direct inspiration. Whilst he approached the house, its
      proprietor arrived there by another path a few minutes before him, and,
      addressing his lady, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, will you come and look at a purchase which an Irishman has
      absolutely compelled me to make? You had better come and see himself, too,
      for he is the greatest simpleton of an Irishman I have ever met with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady&rsquo;s curiosity was more easily excited than that of her husband. She
      not only came out, but brought with her some ladies who had been on a
      visit, in order to hear the Irishman&rsquo;s brogue, and to amuse themselves at
      his expense. Of the pig, too, it appeared she was determined to know
      something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George, my love, is the pig also from Ireland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, my dear; but I should think so from its fleshless
      appearance. I have never seen so spare an animal of that class in this
      country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Juliana,&rdquo; said one of the ladies to her companion, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t go too near
      him. Gracious! look at the bludgeon, or beam, or something he carries in
      his hand, to fight&rsquo; and beat the people, I suppose: yet,&rdquo; she added,
      putting up her glass, &ldquo;the man is actually not ill-looking; and, though
      not so tall as the Irishman in Sheridan&rsquo;s Rivals, he is well made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His eyes are good,&rdquo; said her companion&mdash;&ldquo;a bright gray, and keen;
      and were it not that his nose is rather short and turned up, he would be
      handsome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George, my love,&rdquo; exclaimed the lady of the mansion, &ldquo;he is like most
      Irishmen of his class that I have seen; indeed, scarcely so intelligent,
      for he does appear quite a simpleton, except, perhaps, a lurking kind of
      expression, which is a sign of their humor, I suppose. Don&rsquo;t you think so,
      my love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear; I think him a bad specimen of the Irishman. Whether it is
      that he talks our language but imperfectly, or that he is a stupid
      creature, I cannot say; but in selling the pig just now, he actually told
      me that he would let me have it for more than it was worth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that was so laughable! We will speak to him, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The degree of estimation in which these civilized English held Phil was so
      low, that this conversation took place within a few yards of him,
      precisely as if he had been an animal of an inferior species, or one of
      the aborigines of New Zealand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray what is your name?&rdquo; inquired the matron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phadhrumshagh Corfuffle, plase yer haner: my fadher carried the same name
      upon him. We&rsquo;re av the Corfuflies av Leatherum Laghy, my lady; but my
      grandmudher was a Dornyeen, an&rsquo; my own mudher, plase yer haner, was o&rsquo; the
      Shudhurthagans o&rsquo; Ballymadoghy, my ladyship, <i>Sladh anish, amuck

     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Be quiet now, you wicked pig.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the Negus language,&rdquo; observed,one of the young ladies, who
      affected to be a wit and a blue-stocking; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Irish and English mixed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thrath, an&rsquo; but that the handsome young lady&rsquo;s so purty,&rdquo; observed Phil,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be sayin&rsquo; myself that that&rsquo;s a quare remark upon a poor unlarned man;
      but, Gad bless her, she is so purty what can one say for lookin&rsquo; an her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor man, Adelaide, speaks as well as he can,&rdquo; replied the lady,
      rather reprovingly: &ldquo;he is by no means so wild as one would have
      expected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Candidly speaking, much <i>tamer</i> than I expected,&rdquo; rejoined the wit.
      Indeed, I meant the poor Irishman no offence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you get the pig, friend? and how came you to have it for sale
      so far from home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fwhy it isn&rsquo;t whor sale, my lady,&rdquo; replied Phil, evading the former
      question; &ldquo;the masther here, Gad bless him an&rsquo; spare him to you, ma&rsquo;am!&mdash;thrath,
      an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s his four quarthers that knew how to pick out a wife, any how,
      whor beauty an&rsquo; all hanerable whormations o&rsquo; grandheur&mdash;so he did;
      an&rsquo; well he desarves you, my lady: faix, it&rsquo;s a fine houseful o&rsquo; thim
      you&rsquo;ll have, plase Gad&mdash;an&rsquo; fwhy not? whin it&rsquo;s all in the coorse o&rsquo; 
      Providence, bein&rsquo; both so handsome:&mdash;he gev me a pound note whor her
      my ladyship, an&rsquo; his own plisure aftherwards; an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m now waitin&rsquo; to be
      ped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of a country is Ireland, as I understand you are an Irishman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thrath, my lady, it&rsquo;s like fwhat maybe you never seen&mdash;a fool&rsquo;s
      purse, ten guineas goin&rsquo; out whor one that goes in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word that&rsquo;s wit,&rdquo; observed the young blue-stocking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your opinion of Irishwomen?&rdquo; the lady continued; &ldquo;are they
      handsomer than the English ladies, think you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murdher, my lady,&rdquo; says Phil, raising his caubeen, and scratching his
      head in pretended perplexity, with his linger and thumb, &ldquo;fwhat am I to
      say to that, ma&rsquo;am, and all of yez to the fwhore? But the sarra one av me
      will give it agin the darlin&rsquo;s beyant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But which do you think the more handsome?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thrath, I do, my lady; the Irish and English women would flog the world,
      an&rsquo; sure it would be a burnin&rsquo; shame to go to sot them agin one another
      fwhor beauty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom do you mean by the &lsquo;darlin&rsquo;s beyant?&rsquo;&rdquo; inquired the blue-stocking,
      attempting to pronounce the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix, miss, who but the crathers ower the wather, that kills us entirely,
      so they do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot comprehend him,&rdquo; she added to the lady of the mansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, maybe I&rsquo;d make bould to take up the manners from you fwhor a
      while, my lady, Plase yer haner?&rdquo; said Phil, addressing the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not properly understand you,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;speak plainer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Troth, that&rsquo;s fwhat they do, yer haner; they never go about the bush wit
      yez&mdash;the gintlemen, ma&rsquo;am, of our country, fwhin they do be coortin&rsquo; 
      yez; an&rsquo; I want to ax, ma&rsquo;am, if you plase, fwhat you think of thim, that
      is if ever any of them had the luck to come acrass you, my lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not been acquainted with many Irish gentlemen,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;but
      I hear they are men of a remarkable character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix, &lsquo;tis you may say that,&rdquo; replied Phil; &ldquo;sowl, my lady, &lsquo;tis well for
      the masther here, plase yer haner, sir, that none o&rsquo; them met wit the
      misthress before you was both marrid, or, wit riverence be it spoken, &lsquo;tis
      the sweet side o&rsquo; the tongue they&rsquo;d be layin&rsquo; upon you, ma&rsquo;am, an&rsquo; the
      rough side to the masther himself, along wit a few scrapes of a pen on a
      slip o&rsquo; paper, jist to appoint the time and place, in regard of her
      ladyship&rsquo;s purty complexion&mdash;an&rsquo; who can deny that, any way? Faix,
      ma&rsquo;am, they&rsquo;ve a way wit them, my counthrymen, that the ladies like well
      enough to thravel by. Asy, you deludher, an&rsquo; me in conwersaytion wit the
      quality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite anxious to know how you came by the pig, Paddy,&rdquo; said the wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, miss, sure &lsquo;tisn&rsquo;t pigs you&rsquo;re thinkin&rsquo; on, an&rsquo; us discoorsin&rsquo; 
      about the gintlemen from Ireland, that you&rsquo;re all so fond ow here; faix,
      miss, they&rsquo;re the boys that fwoight for yees, an&rsquo; &lsquo;ud rather be bringing
      an Englishman to the sad fwhor your sakes, nor atin&rsquo; bread an&rsquo; butther.
      Fwhy, now, miss, if you were beyant wit us, sarra ounce o&rsquo; gunpqwdher we&rsquo;d
      have in no time, for love or money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word I should like to see Ireland!&rdquo; exclaimed the blue-stocking;
      &ldquo;but why would the gunpowder get scarce, pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix, fightin&rsquo; about you, miss, an&rsquo; all of yez, sure; for myself sees no
      differ at all in your hanerable fwhormations of beauty and grandheur, an&rsquo; 
      all high-flown admirations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But tell us where you got the pig, Paddy?&rdquo; persisted the wit, struck
      naturally enough with the circumstance. &ldquo;How do you come to have an Irish
      pig so far from home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fwhy thin, miss, &lsquo;twas to a brother o&rsquo; my own I was bringing it, that was
      livin&rsquo; down the counthry here, an&rsquo; fwhin I came to fwhere he lived, the
      sarra one o&rsquo; me knew the place, in regard o&rsquo; havin&rsquo; forgotten the name of
      it entirely, an&rsquo; there was I wit the poor crathur an my hands, till his
      haner here bought it from me&mdash;Gad bless you, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I live, there&rsquo;s a fine Irish blunder,&rdquo; observed the wit; &ldquo;I shall put
      in my commonplace-book&mdash;it will be so genuine. I declare I&rsquo;m quite
      delighted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Paddy,&rdquo; said the gentleman, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s your money. There&rsquo;s a pound for
      you, and that&rsquo;s much more than the miserable animal is worth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Troth, sir, you have the crathur at what we call in Ireland a bargain.*
      Maybe yer haner &lsquo;ud spit upon the money fwhor luck, sir. It&rsquo;s the way we
      do, sir, beyant.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Ironically&mdash;a take in.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Paddy, take it as it is. Good heavens! what barbarous habits
      these Irish have in all their modes of life, and how far they are removed
      from anything like civilization!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank yer haner. Faix, sir, this&rsquo;ll come so handy for the landlord at
      kome, in regard o&rsquo; the rint for the bit o&rsquo; phatie ground, so it will, if I
      can get home agin widout brakin&rsquo; it. Arrah, maybe yer haner &lsquo;ud give me
      the price o&rsquo; my bed, an&rsquo; a bit to ate, sir, an&rsquo; keep me from brakin&rsquo; in
      upon this, sir, Gad bless the money! I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the poor wife an&rsquo; 
      childher, sir&mdash;strivin&rsquo;, so I am, to do fwhor the darlins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor soul,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;he is affectionate in the midst of his
      wretchedness and ignorance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&mdash;here,&rdquo; replied the Englishman, anxious to get rid of him,
      &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a shilling, which I give because you appear to be attached to
      your family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Och, och, fwhat can I say, sir, only that long may you reign ower your
      family, an&rsquo; the hanerable ladies to the fwore, sir. Gad fwhorever bliss
      you, sir, but you&rsquo;re the kind, noble gintleman, an&rsquo; all belongin&rsquo; to you,
      sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having received the shilling, he was in the act of departing, when, after
      turning it deliberately in his hand, shrugging his shoulders two or three
      times, and scratching his head, with a vacant face he approached the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Musha, ma&rsquo;am, an maybe ye&rsquo;d have the tindherness in your heart, seein&rsquo; 
      that the gudness is in yer hanerable face, any way, an&rsquo; it would save the
      skillyeen that the masther gev&rsquo;d for payin&rsquo; my passage, so it would, jist
      to bid the steward, my ladyship, to ardher me a bit to ate in the kitchen
      below. The hunger, ma&rsquo;am, is hard upon me, my lady; an&rsquo; fwhat I&rsquo;m doin&rsquo;,
      sure, is in regard o&rsquo; the wife at home, an&rsquo; the childher, the crathurs,
      an&rsquo; me far fwhrom them, in a sthrange country, Gad help me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a singular being, George! and how beautifully is the economy of
      domestic affection exemplified, notwithstanding his half-savage state, in
      the little plans he devises for the benefit of his wife and children!&rdquo;
       exclaimed the good lady, quite unconscious that Phil was a bachelor.
      &ldquo;Juliana, my love, desire Timmins to give him his dinner. Follow this
      young lady, good man, and she will order you refreshment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gad&rsquo;s blessin&rsquo; upon your beauty an&rsquo; gudness, my lady; an&rsquo; a man might
      thravel far afore he&rsquo;d meet the likes o&rsquo; you for aither o&rsquo; them. Is it the
      other handsome young lady I&rsquo;m to folly, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the young wit, with an arch smile; &ldquo;come after me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thrath, miss, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s an asy task to do that, any way; wit a heart an&rsquo; a
      half I go, acushla; an&rsquo; I seen the day, miss, that it&rsquo;s not much of mate
      an&rsquo; dhrink would thruble me, if I jist got lave to be lookin&rsquo; at you, wit
      nothing but yourself to think an. But the wife an&rsquo; childher, miss, makes
      great changes in us entirely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why you are quite gallant, Paddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trath, I suppose I am now, miss; but you see, my honerable young lady,
      that&rsquo;s our fwhailin&rsquo; at home: the counthry&rsquo;s poor, an&rsquo; we can&rsquo;t help it,
      whedor or not. We&rsquo;re fwhorced to it, miss, whin we come ower here, by you,
      an&rsquo; the likes o&rsquo; you, mavourneen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phil then proceeded to the house, was sent to the kitchen by the young
      lady, and furnished through the steward with an abundant supply of cold
      meat, bread, and beer, of which he contrived to make a meal that somewhat
      astonished the servants. Having satisfied his hunger, he deliberately&mdash;but
      with the greatest simplicity of countenance&mdash;filled the wallet which
      he carried slung across his back, with whatever he had left, observing as
      he did it:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fwhy, thin, &lsquo;tis sthrange it is, that the same custom is wit us in
      Ireland beyant that is here: fwhor whinever a thraveller is axed in, he
      always brings fwhat he doesn&rsquo;t ate along wit him. An sure enough it&rsquo;s the
      same here amongst yez,&rdquo; added he, packing up the bread and beef as he
      spoke, &ldquo;but Gad bliss the custom, any how, fwhor it&rsquo;s a good one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he had secured the provender, and was ready to resume his journey, he
      began to yawn, and to exhibit the most unequivocal symptoms of fatigue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, sir,&rdquo; said he to the steward, &ldquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t have e&rsquo;er an ould barn
      that I&rsquo;d throw myself in fwhor the night? The sarra leg I have to put
      undher me, now that I&rsquo;ve got stiff with the sittin&rsquo; so lang; that, an&rsquo; a
      wishp o&rsquo; sthraw, to sleep an, an&rsquo; Gad bliss you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paddy, I cannot say,&rdquo; replied the steward; &ldquo;but I shall ask my master,
      and if he orders it, you shall have the comfort of a hard floor and clean
      straw, Paddy&mdash;that you shall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many thanks to you, sir: it&rsquo;s in your face, in thrath, the same gudness
      an&rsquo; ginerosity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman, on hearing Phil&rsquo;s request to be permitted a sleeping-place
      in the barn, was rather surprised at his wretched notion of comfort than
      at the request itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, Timmins, let him sleep there,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;give him sacks and
      straw enough. I dare say he will feel the privilege a luxury, poor devil,
      after his fatigue. Give him his breakfast in the morning, Timmins. Good
      heavens,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;what a singular people! What an amazing progress
      civilization must make before these Irish can be brought at all near the
      commonest standard of humanity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Phil, who was determined to back the steward&rsquo;s request,
      approached them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paddy,&rdquo; said the gentleman, anticipating him, &ldquo;I have ordered you sacks
      and straw in the barn, and your breakfast in the morning before you set
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thrath,&rdquo; said Phil, &ldquo;if there&rsquo;s e&rsquo;er a stray blissin&rsquo; goin&rsquo;, depind an
      it, sir, you&rsquo;ll get it fwhor your hanerable ginerosity to the sthranger.
      But about the &lsquo;slip,&rsquo; sir&mdash;if the misthress herself &lsquo;ud shake the

      phaties. Fwhor in regard it cannot spake fwhor itself, sir, it frets as
      wise as a Christyeen, when it&rsquo;s not honestly thrated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never fear, Paddy; we shall take good care of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir, but I aften heered, sir, that you dunno how to feed pigs
      in this counthry in ardher to mix the fwhat an&rsquo; lane, lair (layer) about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how do you manage that in Ireland, Paddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fwhy, sir, I&rsquo;ll tell you how the misthress Gad bless her, will manage it
      fwhor you. Take the crathur, sir, an&rsquo; feed it to-morrow, till its as full

      the fwhat an&rsquo; lane, lair about, beautiful all out, fwhy nirer bl&rsquo;eve
      Phadrumshagh Corfuffle agin. Ay, indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman looked keenly at Phil, but could only read in his
      countenance a thorough and implicit belief in his own recipe for mixing
      the fat and lean. It is impossible to express his contempt for the sense
      and intellect of Phil; nothing could surpass it but the contempt which
      Phil entertained for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he to the servant, &ldquo;I have often heard of the barbarous
      habits of the Irish, but I must say that the incidents of this evening
      have set my mind at rest upon the subject. Good heavens! when will ever
      this besotted country rise in the scale of nations! Did ever a human being
      hear of such a method of feeding swine! I should have thought it
      incredible had I heard it from any but an Irishman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phil then retired to the kitchen, where his assumed simplicity highly
      amused the servants, who, after an hour or two&rsquo;s fun with &ldquo;Paddy,&rdquo;
       conducted him in a kind of contemptuous procession to the barn, where they
      left him to his repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning he failed to appear at the hour of breakfast, but his
      non-appearance was attributed to his fatigue, in consequence of which he
      was supposed to have overslept himself. On going, however, to call him
      from the barn, they discovered that he had decamped; and on looking after
      the &ldquo;slip,&rdquo; it was found that both had taken French leave of the
      Englishman. Phil and the pig had actually travelled fifteen miles that
      morning, before the hour on which he was missed&mdash;Phil going at a
      dog&rsquo;s trot, and the pig following at such a respectful distance as might
      not appear to identify them as fellow-travellers. In this manner Phil sold
      the pig to upwards of two dozen intelligent English gentlemen and farmers,
      and after winding up his bargains successfully, both arrived in Liverpool,
      highly delighted by their commercial trip through England.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passage from Liverpool to Dublin, in Phil&rsquo;s time, was far different to
      that which steam and British enterprise have since made it. A vessel was
      ready to sail for the latter place on the very day of Phil&rsquo;s arrival in
      town; and, as he felt rather anxious to get out of England as soon as he
      could, he came, after selling his pig in good earnest, to the aforesaid
      vessel to ascertain if it were possible to get a deck passage. The year
      had then advanced to the latter part of autumn; so that it was the season
      when those inconceivable hordes of Irishmen who emigrate periodically for
      the purpose of lightening John Bull&rsquo;s labor, were in the act of returning
      to that country in which they find little to welcome them&mdash;but
      domestic affection and misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Phil arrived at the vessel, he found the captain in a state of
      peculiar difficulty. About twelve or fourteen gentlemen of rank and
      property, together with a score or upwards of highly respectable persons,
      but of less consideration, were in equal embarrassment. The fact was, that
      as no other vessel left Liverpool that day, about five hundred Irishmen,
      mostly reapers and mowers, had crowded upon deck, each determined to keep
      his place at all hazards. The captain, whose vessel was small, and none of
      the stoutest, flatly refused to put to sea with such a number. He told
      them it was madness to think of it; he could not risk the lives of the
      other passengers, nor even their own, by sailing with five hundred on the
      deck of so small a vessel. If the one-half of them would withdraw
      peaceably, he would carry the other half, which was as much as he could
      possibly accomplish. They were very willing to grant that what he said was
      true; but in the meantime, not a man of them would move, and to clear out
      such a number of fellows, who loved nothing better than fighting, armed,
      too, with sickles and scythes, was a task beyond either his ability or
      inclination to execute. He remonstrated with them, entreated, raged,
      swore, and threatened; but all to no purpose. His threats and entreaties
      were received with equal good-humor. Gibes and jokes were broken on him
      without number, and as his passion increased, so did their mirth, until
      nothing could be seen but the captain in vehement gesticulation, the
      Irishmen huzzaing him so vociferously, that his damns and curses, uttered
      against them, could not reach even his own ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said he to his cabin passengers, &ldquo;for the love of Heaven, tax
      your invention to discover some means whereby to get one-half of these men
      out of the vessel, otherwise it will be impossible that we can sail
      to-day. I have already proffered to take one-half of them by lot, but they
      will not hear of it; and how to manage I am sure I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The matter, however, was beyond their depth; the thing seemed utterly
      impracticable, and the chances of their putting to sea were becoming
      fainter and fainter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bl&mdash;t their eyes!&rdquo; he at length exclaimed, &ldquo;the ragged, hungry
      devils! If they heard me with decency I could bear their obstinacy bettor:
      but no, they must turn me into ridicule, and break their jests, and turn
      their cursed barbarous grins upon me in my own vessel. I say, boys,&rdquo; he
      added, proceeding to address them once more&mdash;&ldquo;I say, savages, I have
      just three observations to make. The first is,&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, Captain, avourneen, hadn&rsquo;t you betther get upon a stool,&rdquo; said a
      voice, &ldquo;an&rsquo; put a text before it, thin divide it dacently into three
      halves, an&rsquo; make a sarmon of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain, you wor intended for the church,&rdquo; added another. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the
      moral (* model) of a Methodist preacher, if you wor dressed in black.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him alone,&rdquo; said a third; &ldquo;he&rsquo;d be a jinteel man enough in a
      wildherness, an&rsquo; &lsquo;ud make an illigant dancin&rsquo;-masther to the bears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s as graceful as a shaved pig on its hind legs, dancin&rsquo; the
      &lsquo;Baltithrum Jig.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain&rsquo;s face was literally black with passion: he turned away with a
      curse, which produced another huzza, and swore that he would rather
      encounter the Bay of Biscay in a storm, than have anything to do with such
      an unmanageable mob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said a little, shrewd-looking Connaught man, &ldquo;what &lsquo;ud you be
      willin&rsquo; to give anybody, ower an&rsquo; abow his free passage, that &lsquo;ud tell you
      how to get one half o&rsquo; them out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give him a crown,&rdquo; replied the captain, &ldquo;together with grog and
      rations to the eyes: I&rsquo;ll be hanged if I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll do it fwhor you, sir, if you keep your word wit me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done!&rdquo; said the captain; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a bargain, my good fellow, if you
      accomplish it; and, what&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;ll consider you a knowing one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a poor Cannaught man, your haner,&rdquo; replied our friend Phil; &ldquo;but
      what&rsquo;s to prevent me thryin&rsquo;? Tell thim,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that you must go;
      purtind to be for takin&rsquo; thim all wit you, sir. Put Munster agin
      Connaught, one-half on this side, an&rsquo; the odher an that, to keep the
      crathur of a ship steady, your haner; an&rsquo; fwhin you have thim half an&rsquo; 
      half, wit a little room betuxt thim, &lsquo;now,&rsquo; says yer haner, &lsquo;boys, you&rsquo;re
      divided into two halves; if one side kicks the other out o&rsquo; the ship, I&rsquo;ll
      bring the conquirors.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain said not a word in reply to Phil, but immediately ranged the
      Munster and Connaught men on each side of the deck&mdash;a matter which he
      found little difficulty in accomplishing, for each party, hoping that he
      intended to take themselves, readily declared their province, and stood
      together. When they were properly separated, there still remained about
      forty or fifty persons belonging to neither province; but, at Phil&rsquo;s
      suggestion, the captain paired them off to each division, man for man,
      until they were drawn up into two bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there you stand: let one-half of you drub the other out of
      the vessel, and the conquerors shall get their passage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instant was the struggle that ensued for the sake of securing a passage,
      and from the anxiety to save a shilling, by getting out of Liverpool on
      that day. The saving of the shilling is indeed a consideration with Paddy
      which drives him to the various resources of begging, claiming kindred
      with his resident countrymen in England, pretended illness, coming to be
      passed from parish to parish, and all the turnings and shiftings which his
      reluctance to part with money renders necessary. Another night, therefore,
      and probably another day, in Liverpool, would have been attended with
      expense. This argument prevailed with all: with Munster as well as with
      Connaught, and they fought accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the attack first commenced, each, party hoped to be able to expel the
      other without blows. This plan was soon abandoned. In a few minutes the
      sticks and fists were busy. Throttling, tugging, cuffing, and knocking
      down&mdash;shouting, hallooing, huzzaing, and yelling, gave evident proofs
      that the captain, in embracing Phil&rsquo;s proposal, had unwittingly applied
      the match to a mine, whose explosion was likely to be attended with
      disastrous consequences. As the fight became warm, and the struggle more
      desperate, the hooks and scythes were resorted to; blood began to flow,
      and men to fall, disabled and apparently dying. The immense crowd which
      had now assembled to witness the fight among the Irishmen, could not stand
      tamely by, and see so many lives likely to be lost, without calling in the
      civil authorities. A number of constables in a few minutes attended; but
      these worthy officers of the civil authorities experienced very uncivil
      treatment from the fists, cudgels, and sickles of both parties. In fact,
      they were obliged to get from among the rioters with all possible
      celerity, and to suggest to the magistrates the necessity of calling ir
      the military.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime the battle rose into a furious and bitter struggle for
      victory. The deck of the vessel was actually slippery with blood, and many
      were lying in an almost lifeless state. Several were pitched into the
      hold, and had their legs and arms broken by the fall; some were tossed
      over the sides of the vessel, and only saved from drowning by the activity
      of the sailors; and not a few of those who had been knocked down in the
      beginning of the fray were trampled into insensibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Munster men at length gave way; and their opponents, following up
      their advantage, succeeded in driving them to a man out of the vessel,
      just as the military arrived. Fortunately their interference was
      unnecessary. The ruffianly captain&rsquo;s object was accomplished; and as no
      lives were lost, nor any injury more serious than broken bones and
      flesh-wounds sustained, he got the vessel in readiness, and put to sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who would not think that the Irish were a nation of misers, when our
      readers are informed that all this bloodshed arose from their
      unwillingness to lose a shilling by remaining in Liverpool another night?
      Or who could believe that these very men, on reaching home, and meeting
      their friends in a fair or market, or in a public-house after mass on a
      Sunday, would sit down and spend, recklessly and foolishly, that very
      money which in another country they part with as if it were their very
      heart&rsquo;s blood? Yet so it is! Unfortunately, Paddy is wiser anywhere than
      at home, where wisdom, sobriety, and industry are best calculated to
      promote his own interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      This slight sketch of Phil Purcel we have presented to our readers as a
      specimen of the low, cunning Connaught-man; and we have only to add, that
      neither the pig-selling scene, nor the battle on the deck of the vessel in
      Liverpool, is fictitious. On the contrary, we have purposely kept the tone
      of our description of the latter circumstance beneath the reality. Phil,
      however, is not drawn as a general portrait, but as one of that knavish
      class of men called &ldquo;jobbers,&rdquo; a description of swindlers certainly not
      more common in Ireland than in any other country. We have known
      Connaughtmen as honest and honorable as it was possible to be; yet there
      is a strong prejudice entertained against them in every other province of
      Ireland, as is evident by the old adage, &ldquo;Never trust a Connaugtaman.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE GEOGRAPHY OF AN IRISH OATH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      No pen can do justice to the extravagance and frolic inseparable from the
      character of of the Irish people; nor has any system of philosophy been
      discovered that can with moral fitness be applied to them. Phrenology
      fails to explain it; for, so far as the craniums of Irishmen are
      concerned, according to the most capital surveys hitherto made and
      reported on, it appears that, inasmuch as their moral and intellectual
      organs predominate over the physical and sensual, the people ought,
      therefore, to be ranked at the very tip-top of morality. We would warn the
      phrenologists, however, not to be too sanguine in drawing inferences from
      an examination of Paddy&rsquo;s head. Heaven only knows the scenes in which it
      is engaged, and the protuberances created by a long life of hard fighting.
      Many an organ and development is brought out on it by the cudgel, that
      never would have appeared had Nature been left to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drinking, fighting, and swearing, are the three great characteristics of
      every people. Paddy&rsquo;s love of fighting and of whiskey has been long
      proverbial; and of his tact in swearing much has also been said. But there
      is one department of oath-making in which he stands unrivalled and
      unapproachable; I mean the alibi. There is where he shines, where his
      oath, instead of being a mere matter of fact or opinion, rises up into the
      dignity of epic narrative, containing within itself, all the complexity of
      machinery, harmony of parts, and fertility of invention, by which your
      true epic should be characterized.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman, whom we will call the historian in swearing, will depose
      to the truth of this or that fact, but there the line is drawn; he swears
      his oath so far as he knows, and stands still. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure, for my part, I
      don&rsquo;t know; I&rsquo;ve said all I knows about it,&rdquo; and beyond this his besotted
      intellect goeth not.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Scotchman, on the other hand, who is the metaphysician in swearing,
      sometimes borders on equivocation. He decidedly goes farther than the
      Englisman, not because he has less honesty, but more prudence. He will
      assent to, or deny a proposition; for the Englishman&rsquo;s &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; and
      the Scotchman&rsquo;s &ldquo;I dinna ken,&rdquo; are two very distinct assertions when
      properly understood. The former stands out a monument of dulness, an
      insuperable barrier against inquiry, ingenuity, and fancy; but the latter
      frequently stretches itself so as to embrace hypothetically a particular
      opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Paddy! Put him forward to prove an alibi for his fourteenth or
      fifteenth cousin, and you will be gratified by the pomp, pride, and
      circumstance of true swearing. Every oath with him is an epic&mdash;pure
      poetry, abounding with humor, pathos, and the highest order of invention
      and talent. He is not at ease, it is true, under facts; there is something
      too commonplace in dealing with them, which his genius scorns. But his
      flights&mdash;his flights are beautiful; and his episodes admirable and
      happy. In fact, he is an improvisatore at oath-taking; with this
      difference, that his extempore oaths possess all the ease and correctness
      of labor and design.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is not, however, <i>altogether</i> averse to facts: but, like your true
      poet, he veils, changes, and modifies them with such skill, that they
      possess all the merit and graces of fiction. If he happen to make an
      assertion incompatible with the plan of the piece, his genius acquires
      fresh energy, enables him to widen the design, and to create new
      machinery, with such happiness of adaptation, that what appeared out of
      proportion of character is made, in his hands, to contribute to the
      general strength and beauty of the oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tis true, there is nothing perfect under the sun; but if there were, it
      would certainly be Paddy at an <i>alibi</i>. Some flaws, no doubt, occur;
      some slight inaccuracies may be noticed by a critical eye; an occasional
      anachronism stands out, and a mistake or so in geography; but let it be
      recollected that Paddy&rsquo;s alibi is but a human production; let us not judge
      him by harsher rules than those which we apply to Homer, Virgil, or
      Shakspeare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus,&rdquo; is allowed on all hands. Virgil made
      Dido and AEneas contemporary, though they were not so; and Shakspeare, by
      the creative power of his genius, changed an inland town into a seaport.
      Come, come, have bowels. Let epic swearing be treated with the same
      courtesy shown to epic poetry, that is, if both are the production of a
      rare genius. I maintain, that when Paddy commits a blemish he is too
      harshly admonished for it. When he soars out of sight here, as
      occasionally happens, does he not frequently alight somewhere about Sydney
      Bay, much against his own inclination? And if he puts forth a hasty
      production, is he not compelled, for the space of seven or fourteen years,
      to revise his oath? But, indeed, few words of fiction are properly
      encouraged in Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be unpardonable in us, however, to overlook the beneficial
      effects of Paddy&rsquo;s peculiar genius in swearing alibis. Some persons, who
      display their own egregious ignorance of morality, may be disposed to
      think that it tends to lessen the obligation of an oath, by inducing a
      habit among the people of swearing to what is not true. We look upon such
      persons as very dangerous to Ireland and to the repeal of the Union; and
      we request them not to push their principles too far in the disturbed
      parts of the country. Could society hold together a single day, if nothing
      but truth were spoken, would not law and lawyers soon become obsolete, if
      nothing but truth were sworn what would become of parliament if truth
      alone were uttered there? Its annual proceedings might be dispatched in a
      month. Fiction is the basis of society, the bond of commercial prosperity,
      the channel of communication between nation and nation, and not
      unfrequently the interpreter between a man and his own conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      For these, and many other reasons which we could adduce, we say with
      Paddy, &ldquo;Long life to fiction!&rdquo; When associated with swearing, it shines in
      its brightest colors. What, for instance, is calculated to produce the
      best and purest of the moral virtues so beautifully, as the swearing an
      alibi? Here are fortitude and a love of freedom resisting oppression; for
      it is well known that all law is oppression in Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is compassion for the peculiar state of the poor boy, who, perhaps,
      only burned a family in their beds; benevolence to prompt the generous
      effort in his behalf; disinterestedness to run the risk of becoming an
      involuntary absentee; fortitude in encountering a host of brazen-faced
      lawyers; patience under the unsparing gripe of a cross-examiner;
      perseverance in conducting the oath to its close against a host of
      difficulties; and friendship, which bottoms and crowns them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paddy&rsquo;s merits, however, touching the alibi, rest not here. Fiction on
      these occasions only teaches him how to perform a duty. It may be, that he
      is under the obligation of a previous oath not to give evidence against
      certain of his friends and associates. Now, could anything in the whole
      circle of religion or ethics be conceived that renders the epic style of
      swearing so incumbent upon Paddy? There is a kind of moral fitness in all
      things; for where the necessity of invention exists, it is consolatory to
      reflect that the ability to invent is bestowed along with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next to the alibi comes Paddy&rsquo;s powers in sustaining a cross-examination.
      Many person thinks that this is his forte; but we cannot yield to such an
      opinion, nor compromise his originality of conception in the scope and
      plan of an alibi. It is marked by a minuteness of touch, and a peculiarity
      of expression which give it every appearance of real life. The
      circumstances are so well imagined, the groups so naturally disposed, the
      coloring so finished, and the background in such fine perspective, that
      the whole picture presents you with such keeping and <i>vraisemblance</i>,
      as could be accomplished only by the genius of a master.
    </p>
    <p>
      In point of interest, however, we must admit that his ability in a
      cross-examination ranks next to his skill in planning an alibi. There is,
      in the former, a versatility of talent that keeps him always ready; a
      happiness of retort, generally disastrous to the wit of the most
      established cross-examiner; an apparent simplicity, which is quite as
      impenetrable as the lawyer&rsquo;s assurance; a <i>vis comica</i>, which puts
      the court in tears; and an originality of sorrow, that often convulses it
      with laughter. His resources, when he is pressed, are inexhaustible; and
      the address, with which he contrives to gain time, that he may suit his
      reply to the object of his evidence, is beyond all praise. And yet his
      appearance when he mounts the table is anything but prepossessing; a
      sheepish look, and a loose-jointed frame of body, wrapped in a frieze
      great-coat, do not promise much. Nay, there is often a rueful blank
      expression in his visage, which might lead a stranger to anticipate
      nothing but blunders and dulness. This, however, is hypocrisy of the first
      water. Just observe the tact with which he places his caubeen upon the
      table, his kippeen across it, and the experienced air with which he pulls
      up the waistbands of his breeches, absolutely girding his loins for
      battle. &lsquo;Tis true his blue eye has at present nothing remarkable in it,
      except a drop or to of the native; but that is not remarkable.

    <p>
      When the direct examination has been concluded, nothing can be finer than
      the simplicity with which he turns round to the lawyer who is to
      cross-examine him. Yet, as if conscious that firmness and caution are his
      main guards, he again pulls up his waistbands with a more vigorous hitch,
      looks shyly into the very eyes of his opponent, and awaits the first blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question at length comes; and Paddy, after having raised the collar of
      his big coat on his shoulder, and twisted up the shoulder along with it,
      directly puts the query back to the lawyer, without altering a syllable of
      it, for the purpose of ascertaining more accurately whether that is the
      precise question that has been put to him; for Paddy is conscientious.
      Then is the science displayed on both sides. The one, a veteran, trained
      in all the technicalities of legal puzzles, irony, blarney, sarcasm,
      impudence, stock jokes, quirks, rigmarolery, brow-beating, ridicule, and
      subtlety; the other a poor peasant, relying only upon the justice of a
      good cause and the gifts of nature; without either experience, or
      learning, and with nothing but his native modesty to meet the forensic
      effrontery of his antagonist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our readers will perceive that the odds are a thousand to one against
      Paddy; yet, when he replies to a hackneyed genius at cross-examination,
      how does it happen that he uniformly elicits those roars of laughter which
      rise in the court, and convulse it from the judge to the crier? In this
      laugh, which is usually at the expense of the cross-examiner, Paddy
      himself always joins, so that the counsel has the double satisfaction of
      being made not only the jest of the judge and his brother lawyers, but of
      the ragged witness whom he attempted to make ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not impossible that this merry mode of dispensing justice may
      somewhat encourage Paddy in that independence of mind which relishes not
      the idea of being altogether bound by oaths that are too often
      administered with a jocular spirit. To most of the Irish in general an
      oath is a solemn, to some, an awful thing. Of this wholesome reverence for
      its sanction, two or three testimonies given in a court of justice usually
      cured them. The indifferent, business-like manner in which the oaths are
      put, the sing-song tone of voice, the rapid utterance of the words, give
      to this solemn act an appearance of excellent burlesque, which ultimately
      renders the whole proceedings remarkable for the absence of truth and
      reality; but, at the same time, gives them unquestionable merit as a
      dramatic representation, abounding with fiction, well related and ably
      acted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thumb-kissing is another feature in Paddy&rsquo;s adroitness too important to be
      passed over in silence. Here his tact shines out again! It would be
      impossible for him, in many cases, to meet the perplexities of a
      cross-examination so cleverly as he does, if he did not believe that he
      had, by kissing his thumb instead of the book, actually taken no oath, and
      consequently given to himself a wider range of action. We must admit,
      however, that this very circumstance involves him in difficulties which
      are sometimes peculiarly embarrassing. Taking everything into
      consideration, the prospect of freedom for his sixth cousin, the
      consciousness of having kissed his thumb, or the consoling reflection that
      he swore only on a Law Bible, it must be granted that the opportunities
      presented by a cross-examination are well calculated to display his wit,
      humor, and fertility of invention. He is accordingly great in it; but
      still we maintain that his execution of an alibi is his ablest
      performance, comprising, as it does, both the conception and construction
      of the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the oaths and imprecations of the Irish display, like those who use
      them, indications of great cruelty and great humor. Many of the former
      exhibit that ingenuity which comes out when Paddy is on his
      cross-examination in a court of justice. Every people, it is true, have
      resorted to the habit of mutilating or changing in their oaths the letters
      which form the Creator&rsquo;s name; but we question if any have surpassed the
      Irish in the cleverness with which they accomplish it. Mock oaths are
      habitual to Irishmen in ordinary conversation; but the use of any or all
      of them is not considered to constitute an oath: on the contrary, they are
      in the mouths of many who would not, except upon a very solemn occasion
      indeed, swear by the name of the Deity in its proper form.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ingenuity of their mock oaths is sufficient to occasion much
      perplexity to any one disposed to consider it in connection with the
      character and moral feelings of the people. Whether to note it as a
      reluctance on their part to incur the guilt of an oath, or as a proof of
      habitual tact in evading it by artifice, is manifestly a difficulty hard
      to be overcome. We are decidedly inclined to the former; for although
      there is much laxity of principle among Irishmen, naturally to be expected
      from men whose moral state has been neglected by the legislature, and
      deteriorated by political and religious asperity, acting upon quick
      passions and badly regulated minds&mdash;yet we know that they possess,
      after all, a strong, but vague undirected sense of devotional feeling and
      reverence, which are associated with great crimes and awfully dark shades
      of character. This explains one chief cause of the sympathy which is felt
      in Ireland for criminals from whom the law exacts the fatal penalty of
      death; and it also accounts, independently of the existence of any illegal
      association, for the terrible retribution inflicted upon those who come
      forward to prosecute them. It is not in Ireland with criminals as in other
      countries, where the character of a murderer or incendiary is notoriously
      bad, as resulting from a life of gradual profligacy and villany. Far from
      it. In Ireland you will find those crimes perpetrated by men who are good
      fathers, good husbands, good sons, and good neighbors&mdash;by men who
      would share their last morsel or their last shilling with a
      fellow-creature in distress&mdash;who would generously lose their lives
      for a man who had obliged them, provided he had not incurred their enmity&mdash;and
      who would protect a defenseless stranger as far as lay in their power.
      There are some mock oaths among Irishmen which must have had their origin
      amongst those whose habits of thought were much more elevated than could
      be supposed to characterize the lower orders. &ldquo;By the powers of death&rdquo; is
      never now used as we have written it; but the ludicrous travestie of it,
      &ldquo;by the powdhors o&rsquo; delf,&rdquo; is quite common. Of this and other mock oaths
      it may be right to observe, that those who swear by them are in general
      ignorant of their proper origin. There are some, however, of this
      description whose original form is well known. One of these Paddy displays
      considerable ingenuity in using. &ldquo;By the cross&rdquo; can scarcely be classed
      under the mock oaths, but the manner in which it is pressed into
      asseverations is amusing. When Paddy is affirming a truth he swears &ldquo;by
      the crass&rdquo; simply, and this with him is an oath of considerable
      obligation. He generally, in order to render it more impressive,
      accompanies it with suitable action, that is, he places the forefinger of
      each hand across, that he may assail you through two senses instead of
      one. On the contrary, when he intends to hoax you by asserting what is not
      true, he ingeniously multiplies the oath, and swears &ldquo;by the five
      crashes,&rdquo; that is by his own five fingers, placing at the same time his
      four fingers and his thumbs across each other in a most impressive and
      vehement manner. Don&rsquo;t believe him then&mdash;the knave is lying as fast
      as possible, and with no remorse. &ldquo;By the crass o&rsquo; Christ&rdquo; is an oath of
      much solemnity, and seldom used in a falsehood. Paddy also often places
      two bits of straws across, and sometimes two sticks, upon which he swears
      with an appearance of great heat and sincerity&mdash;<i>sed caveto!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Irishmen generally consider iron as a sacred metal. In the interior of the
      country, the thieves (but few in number) are frequently averse to stealing
      it. Why it possesses this hold upon their affections it is difficult to
      say, but it is certain that they rank it among their sacred things,
      consider that to find it is lucky, and nail it over their doors when found
      in the convenient shape of a horse-shoe. It is also used as a medium of
      asserting truth. We believe, however, that the sanction it imposes is not
      very strong. &ldquo;By this blessed iron!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;by this blessed an&rsquo; holy
      iron!&rdquo; are oaths of an inferior grade; but if the circumstance on which
      they are founded be a matter of indifference, they seldom depart from
      truth in using them.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have said that Paddy, when engaged in a fight, is never at a loss for a
      weapon, and we may also affirm that he is never at a loss for an oath.
      When relating a narrative, or some other circumstance of his own
      invention, if contradicted, he will corroborate it, in order to sustain
      his credit or produce the proper impression, by an abrupt oath upon the
      first object he can seize. &ldquo;Arrah, nonsense! by this pipe in my hand, it&rsquo;s
      as thrue as&rdquo;&mdash;and then, before he completes the illustration, he goes
      on with a fine specimen of equivocation&mdash;&ldquo;By the stool I&rsquo;m sittin&rsquo; 
      an, it is; an&rsquo; what more would, you have from me barrin&rsquo; I take my book
      oath of it?&rdquo; Thus does he, under the mask of an insinuation, induce you to
      believe that he has actually sworn it, whereas the oath is always left
      undefined and incomplete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes he is exceedingly comprehensive in his adjurations, and swears
      upon a magnificent scale; as, for instance,&mdash;&ldquo;By the contints of all
      the books that ever wor opened an&rsquo; shut, it&rsquo;s as thrue as the sun to the
      dial.&rdquo; This certainly leaves &ldquo;the five crasses&rdquo; immeasurably behind.
      However, be cautious, and not too confident in taking so sweeping and
      learned an oath upon trust, notwithstanding its imposing effect. We grant,
      indeed, that an oath which comprehends within its scope all the learned
      libraries of Europe, including even the Alexandrian of old, is not only an
      erudite one, but establishes in a high degree the taste of the swearer,
      and displays on his part an uncommon grasp of intellect. Still we
      recommend you, whenever you hear an alleged fact substantiated by it, to
      set your ear as sharply as possible; for, after all, it is more than
      probable that every book by which he has sworn might be contained in a
      nutshell. The secret may be briefly explained:&mdash;Paddy is in the habit
      of substituting the word never for ever. &ldquo;By all the books that never wor
      opened or shut,&rdquo; the reader perceives, is only a nourish of trumpets&mdash;a
      mere delusion of the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, Paddy has oaths rising gradually from the lying ludicrous to the
      superstitious solemn, each of which finely illustrates the nature of the
      subject to which it is applied. When he swears &ldquo;By the contints o&rsquo; Moll
      Kelly&rsquo;s Primer,&rdquo; or &ldquo;By the piper that played afore Moses,&rdquo; you are,
      perhaps, as strongly inclined to believe him as when he draws upon a more
      serious oath; that is, you almost regret the thing is not the gospel that
      Paddy asserts it to be. In the former sense, the humorous narrative which
      calls forth the laughable burlesque of &ldquo;By the piper o&rsquo; Moses,&rdquo; is usually
      the richest lie in the whole range of fiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paddy is, in his ejaculatory, as well as in all his other mock oaths, a
      kind, of smuggler in morality, imposing as often as he can upon his own
      conscience, and upon those who exercise spiritual authority over him.
      Perhaps more of his oaths are blood-stained than would be found among the
      inhabitants of all Christendom put together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paddy&rsquo;s oaths in his amours are generally rich specimens of humorous
      knavery and cunning. It occasionally happens&mdash;but for the honor of
      our virtuous countrywomen, we say but rarely&mdash;that by the honey of
      his flattering and delusive tongue, he succeeds in placing some
      unsuspecting girl&rsquo;s reputation in rather a hazardous predicament. When the
      priest comes to investigate the affair, and to cause him to make
      compensation to the innocent creature who suffered by his blandishments,
      it is almost uniformly ascertained that, in order to satisfy her scruples
      as to the honesty of his promises, he had sworn marriage to her on a book
      of ballads!!! In other cases blank books have been used for the same
      purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, however, you wish to pin Paddy up in a corner, get him a Relic, a
      Catholic prayer-book, or a Douay Bible to swear upon. Here is where the
      fox&mdash;notwithstanding all his turnings and windings upon heretic
      Bibles, books, or ballads, or mock oaths&mdash;is caught at last. The
      strongest principle in him is superstition. It may be found as the prime
      mover in his best and worst actions. An atrocious man, who is
      superstitious, will perform many good and charitable actions, with a hope
      that their merit in the sight of God may cancel the guilt of his crimes.
      On the other hand, a good man, who is superstitiously the slave of his
      religious opinions, will lend himself to those illegal combinations, whose
      object is, by keeping ready a system of organized opposition to an
      heretical government, to fulfil, if a political crisis should render it
      practicable, the absurd prophecies of Pastorini and Columbkil. Although
      the prophecies of the former would appear to be out of date to a rational
      reader, yet Paddy, who can see farther into prophecy than any rational
      reader, honestly believes that Pastorini has left for those who are
      superstitiously given, sufficient range of expectation in several parts of
      his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      We might enumerate many other oaths in frequent use among the peasantry;
      but as our object is not to detail them at full length, we trust that
      those already specified may be considered sufficient to enable our readers
      to get a fuller insight into their character, and their moral influence
      upon the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next thing which occurs to us in connection with the present subject,
      is cursing; and here again Paddy holds the first place. His imprecations
      are often full, bitter, and intense. Indeed, there is more poetry and
      epigrammatic point in them than in those of any other country in the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      We find it a difficult thing to enumerate the Irish curses, so as to do
      justice to a subject so varied and so liable to be shifted and improved by
      the fertile genius of those who send them abroad. Indeed, to reduce them
      into order and method would be a task of considerable difficulty. Every
      occasion, and every fit of passion, frequently produce a new curse,
      perhaps equal in bitterness to any that has gone before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of the Irish imprecations are difficult to be understood, having
      their origin in some historical event, or in poetical metaphors that
      require a considerable process of reasoning to explain them. Of this
      twofold class is that general one, &ldquo;The curse of Cromwell on you!&rdquo; which
      means, may you suffer all that a tyrant like Cromwell would inflict! and
      &ldquo;The curse o&rsquo;the crows upon you!&rdquo; which is probably an allusion to the
      Danish invasion&mdash;a raven being the symbol of Denmark; or it may be
      tantamount to &ldquo;May you rot on the hills, that the crows may feed upon your
      carcass!&rdquo; Perhaps it may thus be understood to imprecate death upon you or
      some member of your house&mdash;alluding to the superstition of rooks
      hovering over the habitations of the sick, when the malady with which they
      are afflicted is known to be fatal. Indeed, the latter must certainly be
      the meaning of it, as is evident from the proverb of &ldquo;Die, an&rsquo; give the
      crow a puddin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hell&rsquo;s cure to you!&mdash;the devil&rsquo;s luck to you!&mdash;high hanging to
      you!&mdash;hard feeling to you!&mdash;a short coorse to you!&rdquo; are all
      pretty intense, and generally used under provocation and passion. In these
      cases the curses just mentioned are directed immediately to the offensive
      object, and there certainly is no want of the <i>malus animus</i> to give
      them energy. It would be easy to multiply the imprecations belonging to
      this class among the peasantry, but the task is rather unpleasant. There
      are a few, however, which, in consequence of their ingenuity, we cannot
      pass over: they are, in sooth, studies for the swearer. &ldquo;May you never die
      till you see your own funeral!&rdquo; is a very beautiful specimen of the
      periphrasis: it simply means, may you be hanged; for he who is hanged is
      humorously said to be favored with a view of that sombre spectacle, by
      which they mean the crowd that attends an execution. To the same purpose
      is, &ldquo;May you die wid a caper in your heel!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;May you die in your
      pumps!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;May your last dance be a hornpipe on the air!&rdquo; These are
      all emblematic of hanging, and are uttered sometimes in jest, and
      occasionally in earnest. &ldquo;May the grass grow before your door!&rdquo; is highly
      imaginative and poetical. Nothing, indeed, can present the mind with a
      stronger or more picturesque emblem of desolation and ruin. Its malignity
      is terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are also mock imprecations as well as mock oaths. Of this character
      are, &ldquo;The devil go with you an&rsquo; sixpence, an&rsquo; thin you&rsquo;ll want neither
      money nor company!&rdquo; This humorous and considerate curse is generally
      confined to the female sex. When Paddy happens to be in a romping mood,
      and teases his sweetheart too much, she usually utters it with a
      countenance combating with smiles and frowns, while she stands in the act
      of pinning up her dishevelled hair; her cheeks, particularly the one next
      Paddy, deepened into a becoming blush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad scran to you!&rdquo; is another form seldom used in anger: it is the same
      as &ldquo;Hard feeding to you!&rdquo; &ldquo;Bad win&rsquo; to you!&rdquo; is &ldquo;Ill health to you!&rdquo; it is
      nearly the same as &ldquo;Consumin&rsquo; (consumption) to you!&rdquo; Two other
      imprecations come under this head, which we will class together, because
      they are counterparts of each other, with this difference, that one of
      them is the most subtilely and intensely withering in its purport that can
      well be conceived. The one is that common curse, &ldquo;Bad &lsquo;cess to you!&rdquo; that
      is, bad success to you: we may identify it with &ldquo;Hard fortune to you!&rdquo; The
      other is a keen one, indeed&mdash;&ldquo;Sweet bad luck to you!&rdquo; Now, whether we
      consider the epithet sweet as bitterly ironical, or deem it as a wish that
      prosperity may harden the heart to the accomplishment of future damnation,
      as in the case of Dives, we must in either sense grant that it is an oath
      of powerful hatred and venom. Occasionally the curse of &ldquo;Bad luck to you!&rdquo;
       produces an admirable retort, which is pretty common. When one man applies
      it to another, he is answered with &ldquo;Good luck to you, thin; but may
      neither of thim ever happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six eggs to you, an&rsquo; half-a-dozen o&rsquo; them rotten!&rdquo;&mdash;like &ldquo;The devil
      go with you an&rsquo; sixpence!&rdquo; is another of those pleasantries which mostly
      occur in the good-humored badinage between the sexes. It implies
      disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a species of imprecation prevalent among Irishmen which we may
      term neutral. It is ended by the word bit, and merely results from a habit
      of swearing where there is no malignity of purpose. An Irishman, when
      corroborating an assertion, however true or false, will often say, &ldquo;Bad
      luck to the bit but it is;&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Divil fire the bit but it&rsquo;s thruth!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Damn
      the bit but it is!&rdquo; and so on. In this form the mind is not moved, nor the
      passions excited: it is therefore probably the most insipid of all their
      imprecations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the most dreadful maledictions are to be heard among the confirmed
      mendicants of Ireland. The wit, the gall, and the poetry of these are
      uncommon. &ldquo;May you melt off the earth like snow off the ditch!&rdquo; is one of
      a high order and intense malignity; but it is not exclusively confined to
      mendicants, although they form that class among which it is most
      prevalent. Nearly related to this is, &ldquo;May you melt like butther before a
      summer sun!&rdquo; These are, indeed, essentially poetical; they present the
      mind with appropriate imagery, and exhibit a comparison perfectly just and
      striking. The former we think unrivalled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the Irish imprecations would appear to have come down to us from
      the Ordeals. Of this class, probably, are the following: &ldquo;May this be
      poison to me!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;May I be roasted on red hot iron!&rdquo; Others of them,
      from their boldness of metaphor, seem to be of Oriental descent. One
      expression, indeed, is strikingly so. When a deep offence is offered to an
      Irishman, under such peculiar circumstances that he cannot immediately
      retaliate, he usually replies to his enemy&mdash;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll sup sorrow for
      this!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll curse the day it happened!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make you rub
      your heels together!&rdquo; All those figurative denunciations are used for the
      purpose of intimating the pain and agony he will compel his enemy to
      suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot omit a form of imprecation for good, which is also habitual
      among the peasantry of Ireland. It is certainly harmless, and argues
      benevolence of heart. We mean such expressions as the following:
      &ldquo;Salvation to me!&mdash;May I never do harm!&mdash;May I never do an ill
      turn!&mdash;May I never sin!&rdquo; These are generally used by men who are
      blameless and peaceable in their lives&mdash;simple and well-disposed in
      their intercourse with the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the head of those Irish imprecations which are dreaded by the people,
      the Excommunication, of course, holds the first and most formidable place.
      In the eyes of men of sense it is as absurd as it is illiberal: but to the
      ignorant and superstitious, who look upon it as anything but a <i>brutum
      fulmen</i>, it is terrible indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next in order are the curses of priests in their private capacity,
      pilgrims, mendicants, and idiots. Of those also Paddy entertains a
      wholesome dread; a circumstance which the pilgrim and mendicant turn with
      great judgment to their own account. Many a legend and anecdote do such
      chroniclers relate, when the family, with whom they rest for the night,
      are all seated around the winter hearth. These are often illustrative of
      the baneful effects of the poor man&rsquo;s curse. Of course they produce a
      proper impression; and, accordingly, Paddy avoids offending such persons
      in any way that might bring him under their displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      A certain class of cursers much dreaded in Ireland are those of the widow
      and the orphan. There is, however, something touching and beautiful in
      this fear of injuring the sorrowful and unprotected. It is, we are happy
      to say, a becoming and prominent feature in Paddy&rsquo;s character; for, to do
      him justice in his virtues as well as in his vices, we repeat that he
      cannot be surpassed in his humanity to the lonely widow and her helpless
      orphans. He will collect a number of his friends, and proceed with them in
      a body to plant her bit of potato ground, to reap her oats, to draw home
      her turf, or secure her hay. Nay, he will beguile her of her sorrows with
      a natural sympathy and delicacy that do him honor; his heart is open to
      her complaints, and his hand ever extended to assist her.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a strange opinion to be found in Ireland upon the subject of
      curses. The peasantry think that a curse, no matter how uttered, will fall
      on something; but that it depends upon the person against whom it is
      directed, whether or not it will descend on him. A curse, we have heard
      them say, will rest for seven years in the air, ready to alight upon the
      head of the person who provoked the malediction. It hovers over him, like
      a kite over its prey, watching the moment when he may be abandoned by his
      guardian angel: if this occurs, it shoots with the rapidity of a meteor on
      his head, and clings to him in the shape of illness, temptation, or some
      other calamity.
    </p>
    <p>
      They think, however, that the blessing of one person may cancel the curse
      of another; but this opinion does not affect the theory we have just
      mentioned. When a man experiences an unpleasant accident, they will say,
      &ldquo;He has had some poor body&rsquo;s curse;&rdquo; and, on the contrary, when he
      narrowly escapes it, they say, &ldquo;He has had some poor body&rsquo;s blessing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There is no country in which the phrases of good-will and affection are so
      strong as in Ireland. The Irish language actually flows with the milk and
      honey of love and friendship. Sweet and palatable is it to the other sex,
      and sweetly can Paddy, with his deluding ways, administer it to them from
      the top of his mellifluous tongue, as a dove feeds her young, or as a kind
      mother her babe, shaping with her own pretty mouth every morse of the
      delicate viands before it goes into that of the infant. In this manner
      does Paddy, seated behind a ditch, of a bright Sunday, when he ought to be
      at Mass, feed up some innocent girl, not with &ldquo;false music,&rdquo; but with
      sweet words; for nothing more musical or melting than his brogue ever
      dissolved a female heart. Indeed, it is of the danger to be apprehended
      from the melody of his voice, that the admirable and appropriate proverb
      speaks; for when he addresses his sweetheart, under circumstances that
      justify suspicion, it is generally said&mdash;&ldquo;Paddy&rsquo;s feedin&rsquo; her up wid
      false music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What language has a phrase equal in beauty and tenderness to <i>cushla
      machree</i>&mdash;<i>pulse of my heart?</i> Can it be paralleled in the
      whole range of all that are, ever were, or ever will be spoken, for music,
      sweetness, and a knowledge of anatomy? If Paddy is unrivalled at swearing,
      he fairly throws the world behind him at the blarney. In professing
      friendship, and making love, give him but a taste of the native, and he is
      a walking honey-comb, that every woman who sees him wishes to have a lick
      at; and Heaven knows, that frequently, at all times, and in all places,
      does he get himself licked on their account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another expression of peculiar force is <i>vick machree</i>&mdash;or, son
      of my heart. This is not only elegant, but affectionate, beyond almost any
      other phrase except the foregoing. It is, in a sense, somewhat different
      from that in which the philosophical poet has used it, a beautiful comment
      upon the sentiment of &ldquo;the child&rsquo;s the father of the man,&rdquo; uttered by the
      great, we might almost say, the glorious, Wordsworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have seen many a youth, on more occasions than one, standing in
      profound affliction over the dead body of his aged father, exclaiming, &ldquo;<i>Ahir,
      vick machree&mdash;vick machree&mdash;wuil thu marra wo&rsquo;um? Wuil thu marra
      wo&rsquo;um?</i> Father, son of my heart, son of my heart, art thou dead from me&mdash;art
      thou dead from me?&rdquo; An expression, we think, under any circumstances, not
      to be surpassed in the intensity of domestic affection which it expresses;
      but under those alluded to, we consider it altogether elevated in
      exquisite and poetic beauty above the most powerful symbols of Oriental
      imagery.
    </p>
    <p>
      A third phrase peculiar to love and affection, is &ldquo;<i>Manim asthee hu&mdash;or</i>,
      My soul&rsquo;s within you.&rdquo; Every person acquainted with languages knows how
      much an idiom suffers by a literal translation. How beautiful, then, how
      tender and powerful, must those short expressions be, uttered, too, with a
      fervor of manner peculiar to a deeply feeling people, when, even after a
      literal translation, they carry so much of their tenderness and energy
      into a language whose genius is cold when compared to the glowing beauty
      of the Irish.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mauourneen dheelish</i>, too, is only a short phrase, but, coming warm
      and mellowed from Paddy&rsquo;s lips into the ear of his <i>colleen dhas</i>, it
      is a perfect spell&mdash;a sweet murmur, to which the <i>lenis susurrus</i>
      of the Hybla bees is, with all their honey, jarring discord. How tame is
      &ldquo;My sweet darling,&rdquo; its literal translation, compared to its soft and
      lulling intonations. There is a dissolving, entrancing, beguiling,
      deluding, flattering, insinuating, coaxing, winning, inveigling, roguish,
      palavering, come-overing, comedhering, consenting, blarneying, killing,
      willing, charm in it, worth all the philters that ever the gross knavery
      of a withered alchemist imposed upon the credulity of those who inhabit
      the other nations of the earth&mdash;for we don&rsquo;t read that these
      shrivelled philter-mongers ever prospered in Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, no&mdash;let Paddy alone. If he hates intensely and effectually, he
      loves intensely, comprehensively, and gallantly. To love with power is a
      proof of a large soul, and to hate well is, according to the great
      moralist, a thing in itself to be loved. Ireland is, therefore, through
      all its sects, parties, and religions, an amicable nation. Their
      affections are, indeed, so vivid, that they scruple not sometimes to kill
      each other with kindness: but we hope that the march of love and
      friendship will not only keep pace with, but outstrip, the march of
      intellect.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Peter Cornell was for many years of his life a pattern and proverb for
      industry and sobriety. He first began the world as keeper of a
      shebeen-house at the cross-roads, about four miles from the town of
      Ballypoteen. He was decidedly an honest man to his neighbors, but a knave
      to excisemen, whom he hated by a kind of instinct that he had, which
      prompted him, in order to satisfy his conscience, to render them every
      practicable injury within the compass of his ingenuity. Shebeen-house
      keepers and excisemen have been, time out of mind, destructive of each
      other; the exciseman pouncing like a beast or bird of prey upon the
      shebeen man and his illicit spirits; the shebeen man staving in the
      exciseman, like a barrel of doublings, by a knock from behind a hedge,
      which sometimes sent him to that world which is emphatically the world of
      spirits. For this, it some happened that the shebeen man was hanged; but
      as his death only multiplied that of the excisemen in a geometrical ratio,
      the sharp-scented fraternity resolved, if possible, not to risk their
      lives, either by exposing themselves to the necessity of travelling by
      night, or prosecuting by day. In this they acted wisely and prudently:
      fewer of the unfortunate peasantry were shot in their rencounters with the
      yeomanry or military on such occasions, and the retaliations became by
      degrees less frequent, until, at length, the murder of a gauger became a
      rare occurrence in the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter, before his marriage, had wrought as laboring servant to a man who
      kept two or three private stills in those caverns among the remote
      mountains, to which the gauger never thought of penetrating, because he
      supposed that no human enterprise would have ever dreamt of advancing
      farther into them than appeared to him to be practicable. In this he was
      frequently mistaken: for though the still-house was in many cases
      inaccessible to horses, yet by the contrivance of slipes&mdash;a kind of
      sledge&mdash;a dozen men could draw a couple of sacks of barley with less
      trouble, and at a quicker pace, than if horses only had been employed. By
      this, and many other similar contrivances, the peasantry were often able
      to carry on the work of private distillation in places so distant, that
      few persons could suspect them as likely to be chosen for such purposes.
      The uncommon personal strength, the daring spirit, and great adroitness of
      Peter Connell, rendered him a very valuable acquisition to his master in
      the course of his illicit occupations. Peter was, in addition to his other
      qualities, sober and ready-witted, so that whenever the gauger made his
      appearance, his expedients to baffle him were often inimitable. Those
      expedients did not, however, always arise from the exigency of the moment;
      they were often deliberately, and with much exertion of ingenuity, planned
      by the proprietors and friends of such establishments, perhaps for weeks
      before the gauger&rsquo;s visit occurred. But, on the other hand, as the
      gauger&rsquo;s object was to take them, if possible, by surprise, it frequently
      happened that his appearance was as unexpected as it was unwelcome. It was
      then that the prompt ingenuity of the people was fully seen, felt, and
      understood by the baffled exciseman, who too often had just grounds for
      bitterly cursing their talent at outwitting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter served his master as a kind of superintendent in such places, until
      he gained the full knowledge of distilling, according to the processes
      used by the most popular adepts in the art. Having acquired this, he set
      up as a professor, and had excellent business. In the meantime, he had put
      together by degrees a small purse of money, to the amount of about twenty
      guineas&mdash;no inconsiderable sum for a young Irishman who intends to
      begin the world on his own account. He accordingly married, and, as the
      influence of a wife is usually not to be controlled during the honey-moon,
      Mrs. Connell prevailed on Peter to relinquish his trade of distiller, and
      to embrace some other mode of life that might not render their living so
      much asunder necessary. Peter suffered himself to be prevailed upon, and
      promised to have nothing more to do with private distillation, as a
      distiller. One of the greatest curses attending this lawless business, is
      the idle and irregular habit of life which it gradually induces. Peter
      could not now relish the labor of an agriculturist, to which he had been
      bred, and yet he was too prudent to sit down and draw his own and his
      wife&rsquo;s support from so exhaustible a source as twenty guineas. Two or
      three days passed, during which &ldquo;he cudgelled his brains,&rdquo; to use his own
      expression, in plans for future subsistence; two or three consultations
      were held with Ellish, in which their heads were laid together, and, as it
      was still the honey-moon, the subject-matter of the consultation, of
      course, was completely forgotten. Before the expiration of a second month,
      however, they were able to think of many other things, in addition to the
      fondlings and endearments of a new-married couple. Peter was every day
      becoming more his own man, and Ellish by degrees more her own woman. &ldquo;The
      purple light of love,&rdquo; which had changed Peter&rsquo;s red head into a rich
      auburn, and his swivel eye into a knowing wink, exceedingly irresistible
      in his bachelorship, as he made her believe, to the country girls, had
      passed away, taking the aforesaid auburn along with it and leaving nothing
      but the genuine carrot behind. Peter, too, on opening his eyes one morning
      about the beginning of the third month, perceived that his wife was, after
      all, nothing more than a thumping red-cheeked wench, with good eyes, a
      mouth rather large, and a nose very much resembling, in its curve, the
      seat of a saddle, allowing the top to correspond with the pummel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pether,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s like a dhrame to me that you&rsquo;re neglectin&rsquo; your
      business, alanna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it you, beauty? but, maybe, you&rsquo;d first point out to me what business,
      barrin&rsquo; buttherin&rsquo; up yourself, I have to mind, you phanix bright?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quit yourself, Pether! it&rsquo;s time for you to give up your ould ways; you
      caught one bird wid them, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s enough. What do you intind to do!
      It&rsquo;s full time for you to be lookin&rsquo; about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lookin&rsquo; about me! What do you mane Ellish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dickens a bit o&rsquo; me thought of it,&rdquo; replied the wife, laughing at the
      unintentional allusion to the circumspect character of Peter&rsquo;s eyes,&mdash;&ldquo;upon
      my faix, I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, thin, but you&rsquo;re full o&rsquo;your fun, sure enough, if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re
      at. Maybe, avourneen, if I had looked right afore me, as I ought to do,
      it&rsquo;s Katty Murray an&rsquo; her snug farm I&rsquo;d have, instead of&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter hesitated. The rapid feelings of a woman, and an Irishwoman, quick
      and tender, had come forth and subdued him. She had not voluntarily
      alluded to his eyes; but on seeing Peter offended, she immediately
      expressed that sorrow and submission which are most powerful when
      accompanied by innocence, and when meekly assumed, to pacify rather than
      to convince. A tear started to her eye, and with a voice melted into
      unaffected tenderness, she addressed him, but he scarcely gave her time to
      speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, avourneen, no, I won&rsquo;t say what I was goin&rsquo; to mintion. I won&rsquo;t
      indeed, Ellish, dear; an&rsquo; forgive me for woundin&rsquo; your feelin&rsquo;s <i>alanna
      dhas</i>. (* My pretty child.) Hell resave her an&rsquo; her farm! I dunna what
      put her into my head at all; but I thought you wor jokin&rsquo; me about my
      eyes: an&rsquo; sure if you war, acushla, that&rsquo;s no rason that I&rsquo;d not allow you
      to do that an&rsquo; more wid your own Pether. Give me a slewsther, (* a kiss of
      fondness) agrah&mdash;a sweet one, now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then laid his mouth to hers, and immediately a sound, nearly resembling
      a pistol-shot, was heard through every part of the house. It was, in fact,
      a kiss upon a scale of such magnitude, that the Emperor of Morocco might
      not blush to be charged with it. A reconciliation took place, and in due
      time it was determined that Peter, as he understood poteen, should open a
      shebeen house. The moment this resolution was made, the wife kept coaxing
      him, until he took a small house at the cross-roads before alluded to,
      where, in the course of a short time, he was established, if not in his
      own line, yet in a mode of life approximating to it as nearly as the
      inclination of Ellish would permit. The cabin which they occupied had a
      kitchen in the middle, and a room at each end of it, in one of which was
      their own humble chaff bed, with its blue quilted drugget cover; in the
      other stood a couple of small tables, some stools, a short form, and one
      chair, being a present from his father-in-law. These constituted Peter&rsquo;s
      whole establishment, so far +as it defied the gauger. To this we must add!
      a five-gallon keg of spirits hid in the garden, and a roll of smuggled
      tobacco. From the former he bottled, over night, as much as was usually
      drank the following day; and from the tobacco, which was also kept under
      ground, he cut, with the same caution, as much as to-morrow&rsquo;s exigencies
      might require. This he kept in his coat-pocket, a place where the gauger
      would never think of searching for it, divided into halfpenny and
      pennyworths, ounces or half-ounces, according as it might be required; and
      as he had it without duty, the liberal spirit in which he dealt it out to
      his neighbors soon brought him a large increase of custom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter&rsquo;s wife was an excellent manager, and he himself a pleasant,
      good-humored man, full of whim and inoffensive mirth. His powers of
      amusement were of a high order, considering his station in life and his
      want of education. These qualities contributed, in a great degree, to
      bring both the young and old to his house during the long winter nights,
      in order to hear the fine racy humor with which he related his frequent
      adventures and battles with excisemen. In the summer evenings, he usually
      engaged a piper or a fiddler, and had a dance, a contrivance by which he
      not only rendered himself popular, but increased his business.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this mode of life, the greatest source of anxiety to Peter and Ellish
      was the difficulty of not offending their friends by refusing to give them
      credit. Many plans, were, with great skill and forethought, devised to
      obviate this evil; but all failed. A short board was first procured, on
      which they got written with chalk&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No credit giv&rsquo;n&mdash;barrin&rsquo; a thrifle to Pether&rsquo;s friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before a week passed, after this intimation, the number of &ldquo;Pether&rsquo;s
      friends&rdquo; increased so rapidly, that neither he nor Ellish knew the half of
      them. Every scamp in the parish was hand and glove with him: the drinking
      tribe, particularly, became desperately attached to him and Ellish. Peter
      was naturally kind-hearted, and found that his firmest resolutions too
      often gave way before the open flattery with which he was assailed. He
      then changed his hand, and left Ellish to bear the brunt of their blarney.
      Whenever any person or persons were seen approaching the house, Peter, if
      he had reason to suspect an attack upon his indulgence, prepared himself
      for a retreat. He kept his eye to the window, and if they turned from the
      direct line of the road, he immediately slipped into bed, and lay close in
      order to escape them. In the meantime they enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God save all here. Ellish, agra machree, how are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God save you kindly! Faix, I&rsquo;m mid-dim&rsquo;, I thank you, Condy: how is
      yourself, an&rsquo; all at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Devil a heartier, barrin&rsquo; my father, that&rsquo;s touched wid a loss of
      appetite afther his meals&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Musha, the dickens be an you, Condy, but you&rsquo;re your father&rsquo;s son, any
      way; the best company in Europe is the same man. Throth, whether you&rsquo;re
      jokin&rsquo; or not, I&rsquo;d be sarry to hear of anything to his disadvantage,
      dacent man. Boys, won&rsquo;t you go down to the other room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go way wid yez, boys, till I spake to Ellish here about the affairs o&rsquo; 
      the nation. Why, Ellish, you stand the cut all to pieces. By the contints
      o&rsquo; the book, you do; Pether doesn&rsquo;t stand it half so well. How is he, the
      thief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throth, he&rsquo;s not well, to-day, in regard of a smotherin&rsquo; about the heart
      he tuck this mornin&rsquo; afther his breakfast. He jist laid himself on the bed
      a while, to see if it would go off of him&mdash;God be praised for all his
      marcies!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thin, upon my <i>sole</i>vation, I&rsquo;m sarry to hear it, and so will all at

     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the sarra taste o&rsquo; kindness was in it at all, Ellish, &lsquo;twas only the
      truth; an&rsquo; as long as I live, I&rsquo;ll stand up for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, how is your aunt down at Carntall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, thin, but middlin&rsquo;, not gettin&rsquo; her health: she&rsquo;ll soon give the
      crow a puddin&rsquo;, any way; thin, Ellish, you thief, I&rsquo;m in for the yallow
      boys. Do you know thim that came in wid me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, thin, I can&rsquo;t say I do. Who are they, Condy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why one o&rsquo; them&rsquo;s a bachelor to my sisther Norah, a very dacent boy,
      indeed&mdash;him wid the frieze jock upon him, an&rsquo; the buckskin breeches.
      The other three&rsquo;s from Teernabraighera beyant. They&rsquo;re related to my
      brother-in-law, Mick Dillon, by his first wife&rsquo;s brother-in-law&rsquo;s uncle.
      They&rsquo;re come to this neighborhood till the &lsquo;Sizes, bad luck to them, goes
      over; for you see, they&rsquo;re in a little throuble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord grant them safe out of it, poor boys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I brought them up here to treat them, poor fellows; an&rsquo;, Ellish,
      avourneen, you must credit me for whatsomever we may have. The thruth is,
      you see, that when we left home, none of us had any notion of drinkin&rsquo; or
      I&rsquo;d a put somethin&rsquo; in my pocket, so that I&rsquo;m taken at an average.&mdash;Bud-an&rsquo;-age!
      how is little Dan? Sowl, Ellish, that goorsoon, when he grows up, will be
      a credit to you. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a finer child in Europe of his age,
      so there isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, he&rsquo;s a good child, Condy. But Condy, avick, about givin&rsquo; credit:&mdash;by
      thim five crasses, if I could give score to any boy in the parish, it &lsquo;ud
      be to yourself. It was only last night that I made a promise against doin&rsquo; 
      such a thing for man or mortual. We&rsquo;re a&rsquo;most broken an&rsquo; harrish&rsquo;d out o&rsquo; 
      house an&rsquo; home by it; an&rsquo; what&rsquo;s more, Condy, we intend to give up the
      business. The landlord&rsquo;s at us every day for his rint, an&rsquo; we owe for the
      two last kegs we got, but hasn&rsquo;t a rap to meet aither o&rsquo; thim; an&rsquo; enough
      due to us if we could get it together: an&rsquo; whisper, Condy, atween
      ourselves, that&rsquo;s what ails Pettier, although he doesn&rsquo;t wish to let an to
      any one about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but you know I&rsquo;m safe, Ellish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you are, avourneen, as the bank itself; an&rsquo; should have what you
      want wid a heart an&rsquo; a half, only for the promise I made an my two knees
      last night, aginst givin&rsquo; credit to man or woman. Why the dickens didn&rsquo;t
      you come yistherday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you, woman alive, that it was by accident, an&rsquo; that I
      wished to sarve the house, that we came at all. Come, come, Ellish; don&rsquo;t
      disgrace me afore my sisther&rsquo;s bachelor an&rsquo; the sthrange boys that&rsquo;s to
      the fore. By this staff in my hand, I wouldn&rsquo;t for the best cow in our
      byre be put to the blush afore thim; an&rsquo; besides, there&rsquo;s a <i>cleeveen</i>
      (* a kind of indirect relationship) atween your family an&rsquo; ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Condy, avourneen, say no more: if you were fed from the same breast wid
      me, I couldn&rsquo;t, nor wouldn&rsquo;t break my promise. I wouldn&rsquo;t have the sin of
      it an me for the wealth o&rsquo; the three kingdoms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beclad, you&rsquo;re a quare woman; an&rsquo; only that my regard for you is great
      entirely, we would be two, Ellish; but I know you&rsquo;re dacent still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then left her and joined his friends in the little room that was
      appropriated for drinking, where, with a great deal of mirth, he related
      the failure of the plan they had formed for outwitting Peter and Ellish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s too many for us! St. Pettier himself wouldn&rsquo;t make
      a hand of her. Faix, she&rsquo;s a cute one. I palavered her at the rate of a
      hunt, an&rsquo; she ped me back in my own coin, with dacent intherest&mdash;but
      no whiskey!&mdash;Now to take a rise out o&rsquo; Pettier. Jist sit where ye
      are, till I come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left them enjoying the intended &ldquo;spree,&rdquo; and went back to Ellish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure, Ellish, if any one had tuck their book oath that you&rsquo;d
      refuse my father&rsquo;s son such a thrifle, I wouldn&rsquo;t believe them. It&rsquo;s not
      wid Pettier&rsquo;s knowledge you do it, I&rsquo;ll be bound. But bad as you thrated
      us, sure we must see how the poor fellow is, at an rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, and before Ellish had time to prevent him, he pressed into
      the room where Peter lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, tare alive, Pether, is it in bed you are at this hour of the day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Who&rsquo;s that&mdash;who&rsquo;s that? oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why thin, the sarra lie undher you, is that the way wid you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&mdash;oh! Eh? Is that Condy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that&rsquo;s to the fore of him. What&rsquo;s asthray wid you man alive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throth, Condy, I don&rsquo;t know, rightly. I went out, wantin&rsquo; my coat, about
      a week ago, an&rsquo; got cowld in the small o&rsquo; the back; I&rsquo;ve a pain in it ever
      since. Be sittin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your heart safe? You have no smotherin&rsquo; or anything upon it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why thin, thank goodness, no; it&rsquo;s all about my back an&rsquo; my inches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divil a thing it is but a complaint they call an <i>alloverness</i> ails
      you, you shkaimer o&rsquo; the world wide. &lsquo;Tis the oil o&rsquo; the hazel, or a
      rubbin&rsquo; down wid an oak towel you want. Get up, I say, or, by this an&rsquo; by
      that, I&rsquo;ll flail you widin an inch o&rsquo; your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it beside yourself you are, Condy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, faix; I&rsquo;ve found you out: Ellish is afther tellin&rsquo; me that it was
      a smotherin&rsquo; on the heart; but it&rsquo;s a pain in the small o&rsquo; the back wid
      yourself. Oh, you born desaver! Get up, I say agin, afore I take the stick
      to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, thin, all sorts o&rsquo; fortune to you, Condy&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&mdash;but
      you&rsquo;re the sarra&rsquo;s pet, for there&rsquo;s no escapin&rsquo; you. What was that I hard
      atween you an&rsquo; Ellish?&rdquo; said Peter, getting up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sarra matther to you. If you behave yourself, we may let you into the
      wrong side o&rsquo; the sacret afore you die. Go an&rsquo; get us a pint of what you
      know,&rdquo; replied Condy, as he and Peter entered the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ellish,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;I suppose we must give it to thim. Give it&mdash;give
      it, avourneen. Now, Condy, whin &lsquo;ill you pay me for this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never fret yourself about that; you&rsquo;ll be ped. Honor bright, as the black
      said whin he stole the boots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now Pettier,&rdquo; said the wife, &ldquo;sure it&rsquo;s no use axin&rsquo; me to give it,
      afther the promise I made last night. Give it yourself; for me, I&rsquo;ll have
      no hand in such things good or bad. I hope we&rsquo;ll soon get out of it
      altogether, for myselfs sick an&rsquo; sore of it, dear knows!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pettier accordingly furnished them with the liquor, and got a promise that
      Condy would certainly pay him at mass on the following Sunday, which was
      only three days distant. The fun of the boys was exuberant at Condy&rsquo;s
      success: they drank, and laughed, and sang, until pint after pint followed
      in rapid succession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every additional inroad upon the keg brought a fresh groan from Ellish;
      and even Peter himself began to look blank as their potations deepened.
      When the night was far advanced they departed, after having first
      overwhelmed Ellish with professions of the warmest friendship, promising
      that in future she exclusively should reap whatever benefit was to be
      derived from their patronage.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, Condy forgot to perform his promise. The next Sunday
      passed, but Peter was not paid, nor was his clever debtor seen at mass, or
      in the vicinity of the shebeen-house, for many a month afterwards&mdash;an
      instance of ingratitude which mortified his creditor extremely. The
      latter, who felt that it was a take in, resolved to cut short all hopes of
      obtaining credit from them in future. In about a week after the foregoing
      hoax, he got up a board, presenting a more vigorous refusal of score than
      the former. His friends, who were more in number than he could have
      possibly imagined, on this occasion, were altogether wiped out of the
      exception. The notice ran to the following effect:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Notice to the Public, <i>and to Pether Connell&rsquo;s friends in particular</i>.&mdash;Divil
      resave the morsel of credit will be got or given in this house, while
      there is stick or stone of it together, barrin&rsquo; them that axes it has the
      ready money.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Pettier X his mark Connell,
     &ldquo;Ellish X her mark Connell.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This regulation, considering everything, was a very proper one. It
      occasioned much mirth among Peter&rsquo;s customers; but Peter cared little
      about that, provided he made the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      The progress of his prosperity, dating it from so small a beginning, was
      decidedly slow. He owed it principally to the careful habits of Ellish,
      and his own sobriety. He was prudent enough to avoid placing any sign in
      his window, by which his house could be known as a shebeen; for he was not
      ignorant that there is no class of men more learned in this species of
      hieroglyphics than excisemen. At all events, he was prepared for them, had
      they come to examine his premises. Nothing that could bring him within the
      law was ever kept visible. The cask that contained the poteen was seldom a
      week in the same place of concealment, which was mostly, as we have said,
      under ground. The tobacco was weighed and subdivided into small
      quantities, which, in addition to what he carried in his pocket, were
      distributed in various crevices and crannies of the house; sometimes under
      the thatch; sometimes under a dish on the dresser, but generally in a damp
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had been about two or three years thus employed, Peter, at the
      solicitation of the wife, took a small farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re stout an&rsquo; able,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;an&rsquo; as I can manage the house widout
      you, wouldn&rsquo;t it be a good plan to take a bit o&rsquo; ground&mdash;nine or ten
      acres, suppose&mdash;an&rsquo; thry your hand at it? Sure you wor wanst the
      greatest man in the parish about a farm. Surely that &lsquo;ud be dacenter nor
      to be slungein&rsquo; about, invintin&rsquo; truth and lies for other people, whin
      they&rsquo;re at their work, to make thim laugh, an you doin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; but
      standin&rsquo; over thim, wid your hands down to the bottom o&rsquo; your pockets? Do,
      Pether, thry it, avick, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll see it &lsquo;ill prosper wid us, plase God?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix I&rsquo;m ladin&rsquo; an asier life, Ellish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But are you ladin&rsquo; a dacenter or a more becominer life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I think, widout doubt, that it&rsquo;s more becominer to walk about like a
      gintleman, nor to be workin&rsquo; like a slave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gintleman! Musha, is it to the fair you&rsquo;re bringin&rsquo; yourself? Why, you
      great big bosthoon, isn&rsquo;t it both a sin an&rsquo; a shame to see you sailin&rsquo; 
      about among the neighbors, like a sthray turkey, widout a hand&rsquo;s turn to
      do? But, any way, take my advice, avillish,&mdash;will you, aroon?&mdash;an&rsquo; 
      faix you&rsquo;ll see how rich we&rsquo;ll get, wid a blessin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ellish, you&rsquo;re a deludher!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, an&rsquo; what suppose? To be sure I am. Usen&rsquo;t you be followin&rsquo; me like
      a calf afther the finger?&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&mdash;Will you do my biddin&rsquo;,
      Pether darlin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter gave her a shrewd, significant wink, in contradiction to what he
      considered the degrading comparison she had just made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ellish, you&rsquo;re beside the mark, you beauty; always put the saddle on the
      right horse, woman alive! Didn&rsquo;t you often an&rsquo; I often swear to me, upon
      two green ribbons, acrass one another, that you liked a red head best, an&rsquo; 
      that the redder it was you liked it the betther?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; it was thruth, too; an&rsquo; sure, by the same a token, whore could I get
      one half so red as your own? Faix, I knew what I was about! I wouldn&rsquo;t
      give you yet for e&rsquo;er a young man in the parish, if I was a widow
      to-morrow. Will you take the land?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So thin, afther all, if the head hadn&rsquo;t been an me, I wouldn&rsquo;t be a
      favorite wid you?&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out wid you, and spake sinse. Throth, if you don&rsquo;t say aither ay or
      no, I&rsquo;ll give myself no more bother about it, There we are now wid some
      guineas together, an&rsquo;&mdash;Faix, Pettier, you&rsquo;re vexin&rsquo; me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want an answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, if it&rsquo;s plasin&rsquo; to your honor, I&rsquo;d have no objection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, will you have my new big coat made agin Shraft?&rdquo; (* Shrovetide)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, will I, in case you do what I say; but if you don&rsquo;t the sarra stitch
      of it &lsquo;ll go to your back this twelvemonth, maybe, if you vex me. Now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you what: my mind&rsquo;s made up&mdash;I will take the land;
      an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll show the neighbors what Pether Connell can do yit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Augh! augh! mavoumeen, that you wor! Throth I&rsquo;ll fry a bit o&rsquo; the bacon
      for our dinner to-day, on the head o&rsquo; that, although I didn&rsquo;t intind to
      touch it till Sunday. Ay, faix, an&rsquo; a pair o&rsquo; stockins, too, along wid the
      coat; an&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; else, that you didn&rsquo;t hear of yit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellish, in fact, was a perfect mistress of the science of wheedling; but
      as it appears instinctive in the sex, this is not to be wondered at. Peter
      himself was easy, or rather indolent, till properly excited by the
      influence of adequate motives; but no sooner were the energies that
      slumbered in him called into activity, than he displayed a firmness of
      purpose, and a perseverance in action, that amply repaid his exertions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing he did, after taking, his little farm, was to prepare for
      its proper cultivation, and to stock it. His funds were not, however,
      sufficient for this at the time. A horse was to be bought, but the last
      guinea they could spare had been already expended, and this purchase was,
      therefore, out of the question. The usages of the small farmers, however,
      enabled him to remedy this inconvenience. Peter made a bargain with a
      neighbor, in which he undertook to repay him by an exchange of labor, for
      the use of his plough and horses in getting down his crop. He engaged to
      give him, for a stated period in the slack season, so many days&rsquo; mowing as
      would cover the expenses of ploughing and harrowing his land. There was,
      however, a considerable portion of his holding potato-ground; this Peter
      himself dug with his spade, breaking it as he went along into fine mould.
      He then planted the seed&mdash;got a hatchet, and selecting the best
      thorn-bush he could find, cut it down, tied a rope to the trunk, seized
      the rope, and in this manner harrowed his potato-ground. Thus did he
      proceed, struggling to overcome difficulties by skill, and substituting
      for the more efficient modes of husbandry, such rude artificial resources
      as his want of capital compelled him to adopt.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, Ellish, seeing Peter acquitting himself in his
      undertaking with such credit, determined not to be outdone in her own
      department. She accordingly conceived the design of extending her
      business, and widening the sphere of her exertions. This intention,
      however, she kept secret from Peter, until by putting penny to penny, and
      shilling to shilling, she was able to purchase a load of crockery. Here
      was a new source of profit opened exclusively by her own address. Peter
      was astonished when he saw the car unloaded, and the crockery piled in
      proud array by Ellish&rsquo;s own hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d take a start out o&rsquo; you. Faix, Pether, you&rsquo;ll see
      how I&rsquo;ll do, never fear, wid the help o&rsquo; Heaven! I&rsquo;ll be off to the market
      in the mornin&rsquo;, plase God, where I&rsquo;ll sell rings around me * o&rsquo; them
      crocks and pitchers. An&rsquo; now, Pether, the sarra one o&rsquo; me would do this,
      good or bad, only bekase your managin&rsquo; the farm so cleverly. Tady
      Gormley&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to bring home his meal from the mill, and has promised to
      lave these in the market for me, an&rsquo; never fear but I&rsquo;ll get some o&rsquo; the
      neighbors to bring them home, so that there&rsquo;s car-hire saved. Faix,
      Pether, there&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; like givin&rsquo; the people sweet words, any way; sure
      they come chape.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * This is a kind of hyperbole for selling a grout
     quantity.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll back you for the sweet words agin any woman in the three
      kingdoms, Ellish, you darlin&rsquo;. But don&rsquo;t you know the proverb, &lsquo;sweet
      words butther no parsnips.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In throth, the same proverb&rsquo;s a lyin&rsquo; one, and ever was; but it&rsquo;s not
      parsnips I&rsquo;ll butther wid &lsquo;em, you gommoch.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Will ever you, you shaver wid the tongue that you are? Will ever you, I
      say? Will ever you make delusion to my head again&mdash;eh?&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Oh, never, never&mdash;but let me go, an&rsquo; me go full o&rsquo; tickles! Oh,
      Pether, avourneen, don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll hurt me, an&rsquo; the way I&rsquo;m in&mdash;quit,
      avillish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bedad, if you don&rsquo;t let my head alone, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;will ever you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, never. There now&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&mdash;oh, but I&rsquo;m as wake as
      wather wid what I laughed. Well now, Pether, didn&rsquo;t I manage bravely&mdash;didn&rsquo;t
      I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till we see the profits first, Ellish&mdash;crockery&rsquo;s very tindher
      goods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay!&mdash;just wait, an&rsquo;I&rsquo;ll engage I&rsquo;ll turn the penny. The family&rsquo;s
      risin&rsquo; wid us.&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very thrue,&rdquo; replied Peter, giving a sly wink at the wife&mdash;&ldquo;no doubt
      of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;Kisin&rsquo; wid us&mdash;I tell you to have sinse, Pether; an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s our
      duty to have something for the crathurs when they grow up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a thruth&mdash;sure I&rsquo;m not sayin&rsquo; against it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that; but what I say is, if we hould an, we may make money.
      Everything, for so far, has thruv wid us, God be praised for it. There&rsquo;s
      another thing in my mind, that I&rsquo;ll be tellin&rsquo; you some o&rsquo; these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe, Ellish, you dhrame about makin&rsquo; money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, an&rsquo; I might do worse; when I&rsquo;m dhramin&rsquo; about it, I&rsquo;m doin&rsquo; no sin
      to any one. But, listen, you must keep the house to-morrow while I&rsquo;m at
      the market. Won&rsquo;t you, Pether?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; who&rsquo;s to open the dhrain in the bottom below?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That can be done the day afther. Won&rsquo;t you, abouchal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ellish, you&rsquo;re a deludher, I tell you. Sweet words;&mdash;sowl, you&rsquo;d
      smooth a furze bush wid sweet words. How-an-ever, I will keep the house
      to-morrow, till we see the great things you&rsquo;ll do wid your crockery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellish&rsquo;s success was, to say the least of it, quite equal to, her
      expectations. She was certainly an excellent wife, full of acuteness,
      industry, and enterprise. Had Peter been married to a woman of a
      disposition resembling his own, it is probable that he would have sunk
      into indolence, filth, and poverty, these miseries might have soured their
      tempers, and driven them into all the low excesses and crimes attendant
      upon pauperism. Ellish, however, had sufficient spirit to act upon Peter&rsquo;s
      natural indolence, so as to excite it to the proper pitch. Her mode of
      operation was judiciously suited to his temper. Playfulness and kindness
      were the instruments by which she managed him. She knew that violence, or
      the assumption of authority, would cause a man who, like him, was stern
      when provoked, to react, and meet her with an assertion of his rights and
      authority not to be trifled with. This she consequently avoided, not
      entirely from any train of reasoning on the subject; but from that
      intuitive penetration which taught her to know that the plan she had
      resorted to was best calculated to make him subservient to her own
      purposes, without causing him to feel that he was governed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, every day brought out her natural cleverness more clearly. Her
      intercourse with the world afforded her that facility of understanding the
      tempers and dispositions of others, which can never be acquired when it
      has not been bestowed as a natural gift. In her hands it was a valuable
      one. By degrees her house improved in its appearance, both inside and
      outside. From crockery she proceeded to herrings, then to salt, in each of
      which she dealt with surprising success. There was, too, such an air of
      bustle, activity, and good-humor about her that people loved to deal with
      her. Her appearance was striking, if not grotesque. She was tall and
      strong, walked rapidly, and when engaged in fair or market disposing of
      her coarse merchandise, was dressed in a short red petticoat, blue
      stockings, strong brogues, wore a blue cloak, with the hood turned up,
      over her head, on the top of which was a man&rsquo;s hat, fastened by a, ribbon
      under her chin. As she thus stirred about, with a kind word and a joke for
      every one, her healthy cheek in full bloom, and her blue-gray eye beaming
      with an expression of fun and good-nature, it would be difficult to
      conceive a character more adapted for intercourse with, a laughter-loving
      people. In fact, she soon became a favorite, and this not the less that
      she was as ready to meet her rivals in business with a blow as with a
      joke. Peter witnessed her success with unfeigned pleasure; and although
      every feasible speculation was proposed by her, yet he never felt that he
      was a mere nonentity when compared to his wife. &lsquo;Tis true, he was
      perfectly capable of executing her agricultural plans when she proposed
      them, but his own capacity for making a lucky hit was very limited. Of the
      two, she was certainly the better farmer; and scarcely an improvement took
      place in his little holding which might not be traced to Ellish.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of a couple of years she bought him a horse, and Peter was
      enabled, to join with a neighbor, who had another. Each had a plough and
      tackle, so that here was a little team made up, the half of which belonged
      to Peter. By this means they ploughed week about, until their crops were
      got down. Peter finding his farm doing well, began to feel a kind of
      rivalship with his wife&mdash;that is to say, she first suggested the
      principle, and afterwards contrived to make him imagine that it was
      originally his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sarra one o&rsquo; you, Pettier,&rdquo; she exclaimed to him one day, &ldquo;but&rsquo;s
      batin&rsquo; me out an&rsquo; out. Why, you&rsquo;re the very dickins at the farmin&rsquo;, so you
      are. Faix, I suppose, if you go an this way much longer, that you&rsquo;ll be
      thinkin&rsquo; of another farm, in regard that we have some guineas together.
      Pettier, did you ever think of it, abouchal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure, I did, you beauty; an&rsquo; amn&rsquo;t I in fifty notions to take Harry
      Neal&rsquo;s land, that jist lies alongside of our own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;re right, maybe; but if it&rsquo;s strivin&rsquo; again me you are, you
      may give it over: I tell you, I&rsquo;ll have more money made afore this time
      twelvemonth than you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, is it jokin&rsquo; you are? More money? Would you advise me to take
      Harry&rsquo;s land? Tell me that first, you phanix, an&rsquo; thin I&rsquo;m your man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix, take your own coorse, avourneen. If you get a lase of it at a fair
      rint, I&rsquo;ll buy another horse, any how. Isn&rsquo;t that doin&rsquo; the thing
      dacent&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More power to you, Ellish! I&rsquo;ll hold you a crown, I pay you the price o&rsquo; 
      the horse afore this time twelvemonth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done! The sarra be off me but done!&mdash;an&rsquo; here&rsquo;s Barny Dillon an&rsquo; 
      Katty Hacket to bear witness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure enough we will,&rdquo; said Barny, the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll back the misthress any money,&rdquo; replied the maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two to one on the masther,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;Whoo! our side o&rsquo; the house
      for ever! Come, Pether, hould up your head, there&rsquo;s money bid for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ellish, I&rsquo;ll fight for you ankle deep,&rdquo; said Katty&mdash;&ldquo;depind your
      life an me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name o&rsquo; goodness, thin, it&rsquo;s a bargain,&rdquo; said Ellish; &ldquo;an&rsquo; at the
      end o&rsquo; the year, if we&rsquo;re spared, we&rsquo;ll see what we&rsquo;ll see. We&rsquo;ll have
      among ourselves a little sup o&rsquo; tay, plase goodness, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll be
      comfortable. Now, Barny, go an&rsquo; draw home thim phaties from the pits while
      the day&rsquo;s fine; and Katty, a colleen, bring in some wather, till we get
      the pig killed and scalded&mdash;it&rsquo;ll hardly have time to be good bacon
      for the big markets at Christmas. I don&rsquo;t wish,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;to keep
      it back from them that we have a thrifle o&rsquo; money. One always does betther
      when it&rsquo;s known that they&rsquo;re not strugglin&rsquo;. There&rsquo;s Nelly Cummins, an&rsquo; 
      her customers is lavin&rsquo; her, an&rsquo; dalin&rsquo; wid me, bekase she&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; down in
      business. Ay an&rsquo;, Pether, ahagur, it&rsquo;s the way o&rsquo; the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well but, Ellish, don&rsquo;t you be givin&rsquo; Nelly Cummins the harsh word, or
      lanin&rsquo; too heavily upon her, the crathur, merely in regard that she is
      goin&rsquo; down. Do you hear, acolleen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I don&rsquo;t do it, Pether; but you know she has a tongue like a razor
      at times, and whin it gets loose she&rsquo;d provoke St. Pether himself. Thin
      she&rsquo;s takin&rsquo; to the dhrink, too, the poor misfortunate vagabone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, that&rsquo;s no affair o&rsquo; yours, or mine aither&mdash;only don&rsquo;t be
      risin&rsquo; ructions and norrations wid her. You <i>threwn</i> a jug at her the
      last day you war out, an&rsquo; hot the poor ould Potticary as he was passin&rsquo;.
      You see I hard that, though you kept it close from me!&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha, ha!&mdash;why you&rsquo;d split if you had seen the crathur whin he
      fell into Pether White&rsquo;s brogue-creels, wid his heels up. But what right
      had she to be sthrivin&rsquo; to bring away my customers afore my face? Ailey
      Dogherty was buying a crock wid me, and Nelly shouts over to her from
      where she sot like a queen on her stool, &lsquo;Ailey,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;here&rsquo;s a
      betther one for three fardens less, an&rsquo; another farden &lsquo;ill get you a
      pennorth o&rsquo; salt.&rsquo; An&rsquo;, indeed, Ailey walks over, manely enough, an&rsquo; tuck
      her at her word. Why, flesh an&rsquo; blood couldn&rsquo;t bear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;re raal flesh and blood, Ellish, if that&rsquo;s thrue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but consarnin&rsquo; what I mintioned awhile agone&mdash;hut! the poor
      mad crathur, let us have no more discoorse about her&mdash;I say, that no
      one ever thrives so well as when the world sees that they are gettin&rsquo; an,
      an&rsquo; prosperin&rsquo;; but if there&rsquo;s not an appearance, how will any one know
      whether we are prosperin&rsquo; or not, barrin&rsquo; they see some sign of it about
      us; I mane, in a quiet rasonable way, widout show or extravagance. In the
      name o&rsquo; goodness, thin, let us get the house brushed up, an&rsquo; the outhouses
      dashed. A bushel or two of lime &lsquo;ill make this as white as an egg widin,
      an&rsquo; a very small expinse will get it plastered, and whitewashed widowt.
      Wouldn&rsquo;t you like it, avourneen? Eh, Pether?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure I&rsquo;d like it. It&rsquo;ll give a respectful look to the house and
      place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;ll bring customers, that&rsquo;s the main thing. People always like
      to come to a snug, comfortable place. An&rsquo;, plase God, I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; of
      another plan that I&rsquo;ll soon mintion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; what may that be, you skamer? Why, Ellish, you&rsquo;ve ever and always
      some skam&rsquo;e or other in that head o&rsquo; yours. For my part, I don&rsquo;t know how
      you get at them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no matter, acushla, do you only back me; just show me how I ought
      to go on wid them, for nobody can outdo you at such things, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
      engage we&rsquo;ll thrive yit, always wid a blessin&rsquo; an us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, to tell God&rsquo;s thruth, I&rsquo;d bate the devil himself at plannin&rsquo; out,
      an&rsquo; bringin&rsquo; a thing to a conclusion&mdash;eh, you deludher?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sarra doubt of it; but takin&rsquo; the other farm was the brightest
      thought I seen wid you yit. Will you do it, avillish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure. Don&rsquo;t I say it? An&rsquo; it&rsquo;ll be up wid the lark wid me. Hut,
      woman, you don&rsquo;t see the half o&rsquo; what&rsquo;s in me, yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy you a hat and a pair o&rsquo; stockins at Christmas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you, Ellish? Then, by the book, I&rsquo;ll work like a horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t intind to tell you, but I had it laid out for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, you&rsquo;re a beauty, Ellish. What&rsquo;ll we call this young chap that&rsquo;s
      comin&rsquo;, acushla?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Pether, none o&rsquo; your capers. It&rsquo;s time enough when the thing happens
      to be thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; that, Glory be to God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you may talk as you plase, but I&rsquo;ll call him Pether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; how do you know but he&rsquo;ll be a girl, you omadhawn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murdher alive, ay, sure enough! Faith, I didn&rsquo;t think o&rsquo; that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go up now an&rsquo; spake to Misther Eccles about the land; maybe
      somebody else &lsquo;ud slip in afore us, an&rsquo; that wouldn&rsquo;t be pleasant. Here&rsquo;s
      your brave big coat, put it an; faix, it makes a man of you&mdash;gives
      you a bodagh* look entirely; but that&rsquo;s little to what you&rsquo;ll be yet, wid
      a blessin&rsquo;&mdash;a Half-Sir, any way.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * This word is used in Ireland sometimes in a good and
     sometimes in a bad sense. For instance, the peasantry
     will often say in allusion to some individual who may
     happen to be talked of, &ldquo;Hut! he&rsquo;s a dirty bodagh;&rdquo; but
     again, you may hear them use it in a sense directly the
     reverse of this; for instance, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a very dacent
     man, and looks the bodagh entirely.&rdquo; As to the &ldquo;Half
     sir,&rdquo; he stands about half-way between the bodagh and
     the gentleman, Bodagh&mdash;signifying churl&mdash;was applied
     originally as a term of reproach to the English
     settlers.
</pre>
    <p>
      In fact, Ellish&rsquo;s industry had already gained a character for both herself
      and her husband. He got credit for the assiduity and activity to which she
      trained him: and both were respected for their cleverness in advancing
      themselves from so poor a beginning to the humble state of independence
      they had then reached. The farm which Ellish was so anxious to secure was
      the property of the gentleman from whom they held the other. Being a man
      of sense and penetration, he fortunately saw&mdash;what, indeed, was
      generally well known&mdash;that Peter and Ellish were rising in the world,
      and that their elevation was the consequence of their own unceasing
      efforts to become independent, so that industry is in every possible point
      of view its own reward. So long as the farm was open to competition the
      offers for it multiplied prodigiously, and rose in equal proportion.
      Persons not worth twenty shillings in the world offered double the rent
      which the utmost stretch of ingenuity, even with suitable capital, could
      pay. New-married couples, with nothing but the strong imaginative hopes
      peculiar to their country, proposed for it in a most liberal spirit. Men
      who had been ejected out of their late farms for non-payment of rent, were
      ready to cultivate this at a rent much above that which, on better land,
      they were unable to pay. Others, who had been ejected from farm after farm&mdash;each
      of which they undertook as a mere speculation, to furnish them with
      present subsistence, but without any ultimate expectation of being able to
      meet their engagements&mdash;came forward with the most laudable efforts.
      This gentleman, however, was none of those landlords who are so besotted
      and ignorant of their own interests, as to let their lands simply to the
      highest bidders, without taking into consideration their capital, moral
      character, and habits of industry. He resided at home, knew his tenants
      personally, took an interest in their successes and difficulties, and
      instructed them in the best modes of improving their farms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter&rsquo;s first interview with him was not quite satisfactory on either
      side. The honest man was like a ship without her rudder, when transacting
      business in the absence of his wife. The fact was, that on seeing the high
      proposals which were sent in, he became alarmed lest, as he flattered
      himself, that the credit of the transaction should be all his own, the
      farm might go into the hands of another, and his character for cleverness
      suffer with Ellish. The landlord was somewhat astounded at the rent which
      a man who bore so high a name for prudence offered him. He knew it was
      considerably beyond what the land was worth, and he did not wish that any
      tenant coming upon his estate should have no other prospect than that of
      gradually receding into insolvency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot give you any answer now,&rdquo; said he to Peter; &ldquo;but if you will
      call in a day or two I shall let you know my final determination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter, on coming home, rendered an account of his interview with the
      landlord to his wife, who no sooner heard of the extravagant proposal he
      made, than she raised her hands and eyes, exclaiming&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, thin, Pether, alanna, was it beside yourself you wor, to go for to
      offer a rint that no one could honestly pay! Why, man alive, it &lsquo;ud lave
      us widout house or home in do time, all out! Sure Pettier, acushla, where
      &lsquo;ud be the use of us or any one takin&rsquo; land, barrin&rsquo; they could make
      somethin&rsquo; by it? Faix, if the gintleman had sinse, he wouldn&rsquo;t give the
      same farm to anybody at sich a rint; an&rsquo; for good rasons too&mdash;bekase
      they could never pay it, an&rsquo; himself &lsquo;ud be the sufferer in the long run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dang me, but you&rsquo;re the long-headedest woman alive this day, Ellish. Why,
      I never wanst wint into the rason o&rsquo; the thing, at all. But you don&rsquo;t know
      the offers he got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I? Why do you think he&rsquo;d let the Mullins, or the Conlans, or the
      O&rsquo;Donog-hoes, or the Duffys, upon his land, widout a shillin&rsquo; in one o&rsquo; 
      their pockets to stock it, or to begin workin&rsquo; it properly wid. Hand me my
      cloak from the pin there, an&rsquo; get your hat. Katty, avourneen, have an eye
      to the house till we come back; an&rsquo; if Dick Murphy comes here to get
      tobaccy on score, tell him I can&rsquo;t afford it, till he pays up what he got.
      Come, Pether, in the name o&rsquo; goodness&mdash;come, abouchal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellish, during their short journey to the landlord&rsquo;s, commenced, in her
      own way, a lecture upon agricultural economy, which, though plain and
      unvarnished, contained excellent and practical sense. She also pointed out
      to him when to speak and when to be silent; told him what rent to offer,
      and in what manner he should offer it; but she did all this so dexterously
      and sweetly, that honest Peter thought the new and corrected views which
      she furnished him with, were altogether the result of his own penetration.
      The landlord was at home when they arrived, and ordered them into the
      parlor, where he soon made his appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Connell,&rdquo; said he, smiling, &ldquo;are you come to make me a higher
      offer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why thin no, plase your honor,&rdquo; replied Peter, looking for confidence to
      Ellish: &ldquo;instead o&rsquo; that, sir, Ellish here&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never heed me, alanna; tell his honor what you&rsquo;ve to say, out o&rsquo; the
      face. Go an acushla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, your honor, to tell the blessed thruth, the dickens a bit o&rsquo; myself
      but had a sup in my head when I was wid your honor to-day before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellish was thunderstruck at this most unexpected apology from Peter; but
      the fact was, that the instructions which she had given him on their way
      had completely evaporated from his brain, and he felt himself thrown
      altogether upon his own powers of invention. Here, however, he was at
      home; for it was well known among all his acquaintances, that, however he
      might be deficient in the management of a family when compared to his
      wife, he was capable, notwithstanding, of exerting a certain imaginative
      faculty in a very high degree. Ellish felt that to contradict him on the
      spot must lessen both him and herself in the opinion of the landlord, a
      circumstance that would have given her much pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that, Connell,&rdquo; said Mr. Eccles; &ldquo;you bear the
      character of being strictly sober in your habits. You must have been early
      at the bottle, too, which makes your apology rather unhappy. Of all
      tipplers, he who drinks early is the worst and most incurable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thrue for you, sir, but this only happens me wanst a year, your honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once a year! But, by the by, you had no appearance of being tipsy,
      Peter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tipsy! Bud-a&rsquo;-age, your honor, I was never seen tipsy in all my life,&rdquo;
       said Peter,&mdash;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a horse of another color, sir, plase your
      honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reader must at once perceive that Peter here was only recovering
      himself from the effects of the injurious impression which his first
      admission was calculated to produce against him in the mind of his
      landlord. &ldquo;Tipsy! No, no, sir; but the rason of it, sir, was this: it
      bein&rsquo; my birthday, sir, I merely tuck a sup in the mornin&rsquo;, in honor o&rsquo; 
      the day. It&rsquo;s altogether a lucky day to me, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, to be sure, every man&rsquo;s birthday may, probably, be called such&mdash;the
      gift of existence being, I fear, too much undervalued.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bedad, your honor, I don&rsquo;t mane that, at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what do you mean, Peter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sir, you see, it&rsquo;s not that I was <i>entirely</i> born on this day,
      but partly, sir; I was marrid to Ellish here into the bargain,&mdash;one
      o&rsquo; the best wives, sir&mdash;however, I&rsquo;ll say no more, as she&rsquo;s to the
      fore herself. But, death alive, sir, sure when we put both conclusions
      together&mdash;myself bein&rsquo; sich a worthy man, and Ellish such a tip-top
      wife, who could blame me for smellin&rsquo; the bottle?&mdash;for divil a much
      more I did&mdash;about two glasses, sir&mdash;an&rsquo; so it got up into my
      head a little when I was wid your honor to-day before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is the amount of all this, Peter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sir, you see only I was as I said, Sir&mdash;not tipsy, your honor,
      any way, but seein&rsquo; things double or so; an&rsquo; that was, I suppose, what
      made me offer for the farm double what I intinded. Every body knows, sir,
      that the &lsquo;crathur&rsquo; gives the big heart to us, any how, your honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know, Peter, we entered into no terms about it. I, therefore,
      have neither power nor inclination to hold you to the offer you made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, sir, you&rsquo;re not the gintleman to do a shabby turn, nor ever was,
      nor one o&rsquo; your family. There&rsquo;s not in all Europe&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellish, who was a point blank dealer, could endure Peter&rsquo;s mode of
      transacting business no longer. She knew that if he once got into the true
      spirit of applying the oil of flattery to the landlord, he would have
      rubbed him into a perfect froth ere he quitted him. She, therefore, took
      up the thread of the discourse, and finished the compliment with much more
      delicacy than honest Peter could have displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thrue for you, Pether,&rdquo; she added; &ldquo;there is not a kinder family to the
      poor, nor betther landlords in the country they live in. Pether an&rsquo; 
      myself, your honor, on layin&rsquo; both our &lsquo;heads together, found that he
      offered more rint for the land nor any! tenant could honestly pay. So,
      sir, where&rsquo;s the use of keepin&rsquo; back God&rsquo;s truth&mdash;Pether, sir&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter here trembled from an apprehension that the wife, in accomplishing
      some object of her own in reference to the land, was about to undeceive
      the landlord, touching the lie which he had so barefacedly palmed upon
      that worthy gentleman for truth. In fact, his anxiety overcame his
      prudence, and he resolved to anticipate her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d advise you, sir,&rdquo; said he, with a smile of significant good-humor,
      &ldquo;to be a little suspicious of her, for, to tell the truth, she draws the&rdquo;&mdash;here
      he illustrated the simile with his staff&mdash;&ldquo;the long bow of an odd
      time; faith she does. I&rsquo;d kiss the book on the head of what I tould you,
      sir, plase your honor. For the sacret of it is, that I tuck the moistare
      afore she left her bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Peter, alanna,&rdquo; said Ellish, soothingly, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; over you, at
      all, an&rsquo; me; goin&rsquo; to explain to his honor the outs and ins I of our
      opinion about the land? Faix, man, we&rsquo;re not thinkin&rsquo; about you, good or
      bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe the drop has scarcely left your head yet, Peter,&rdquo; said the
      landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bud-an&rsquo;-age, your honor, sure we must have our joke, any how&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t
      she deserve it for takin&rsquo; the word out o&rsquo; my mouth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whisht, avillish; you&rsquo;re too cute for us all, Pether. There&rsquo;s no use,
      sir, as I was sayin&rsquo;, for any one to deny that when they take a farm they
      do it to make by it, or at the laste to live comfortably an it. That&rsquo;s the
      thruth, your honor, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s no use to keep it back from you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I perfectly agree with you,&rdquo; said the landlord. &ldquo;It is with these motives
      that a tenant should wish to occupy land; and it is the duty of every
      landlord who has his own interest truly at heart, to see that his land be
      not let at such a rent as will preclude the possibility of comfort or
      independence on the part of his tenantry. He who lets his land above its
      value, merely because people are foolish enough to offer more for it than
      it is worth, is as great an enemy to himself as he is to the tenant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s thruth, sir, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; else but a comfort to hear sich
      words comin&rsquo; from the lips of a gintleman that&rsquo;s a landlord himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, an&rsquo; a good one, too,&rdquo; said Peter; &ldquo;an&rsquo; kind father for his honor to
      be what he is. Divil resave the family in all Europe&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thrue for you, avourneen, an&rsquo; even&rsquo; one knows that. We wor talkin&rsquo; it
      over, sir, betuxt ourselves, Pether an&rsquo; me, an&rsquo; he says very cutely, that,
      upon second thoughts, he offered more nor we could honestly pay out o&rsquo; the
      land: so&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, it&rsquo;s a thrue as gospel, your honor. Says I, &lsquo;Ellish, you beauty&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; observed Mr. Eccles, &ldquo;that she sometimes drew the long bow,
      Peter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, murdher alive, sir, it was only in regard of her crassin&rsquo; in an&rsquo; 
      whippin&rsquo; the word out o&rsquo; my mouth, that I wanted to take a rise out of
      her. Oh, bedad, sir, no; the crathur&rsquo;s thruth to the backbone, an&rsquo; farther
      if I&rsquo;d say it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, your honor, considherin&rsquo; everything, we&rsquo;re willin&rsquo; to offer thirty
      shillin&rsquo;s an acre for the farm. That rint, sir, we&rsquo;ll be able to pay, wid
      the help o&rsquo; God, for sure we can do nothin&rsquo; widout his assistance, glory
      be to his name! You&rsquo;ll get many that&rsquo;ll offer you more, your honor; but if
      it &lsquo;ud be plasin&rsquo; to you to considher what manes they have to pay it, I
      think, sir, you&rsquo;d see, out o&rsquo; your own sinse, that it&rsquo;s not likely people
      who is gone to the bad, an&rsquo; has nothin&rsquo; could stand it out long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to heaven,&rdquo; replied Mr. Eccles, &ldquo;that every tenant in Ireland
      possessed your prudence and good sense. Will you permit me to ask, Mrs.
      Connell, what capital you and your husband can command provided I should
      let you have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wid every pleasure in life, sir, for it&rsquo;s but a fair question to put. An&rsquo; 
      sure, it is to God we owe it, whatever it is, plase your honor. But, sir,
      if we get the land, we&rsquo;re able to stock it, an&rsquo; to crop it well an&rsquo; 
      dacently; an&rsquo; if your honor would allow us for sartin improvements, sir,
      we&rsquo;d run it into snug fields, by plantin&rsquo; good hedges, an&rsquo; gettin&rsquo; up
      shelther for the outlyin&rsquo; cattle in the hard seasons, plase your honor,
      and you know the farm is very naked and bare of shelter at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sowl, will we, sir, an&rsquo; far more nor that if we get it. I&rsquo;ll undhertake,
      sir, to level&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Pether, we&rsquo;ll promise no more nor we&rsquo;ll do; but anything that his
      honor will be plased to point out to us, if we get fair support, an&rsquo; that
      it remains on the farm afther us, we&rsquo;ll be willin&rsquo; to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willin&rsquo;!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter!&mdash;&ldquo;faith, whether we&rsquo;re willin&rsquo; or not, if
      his honor but says the word&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Connell,&rdquo; said their landlord, &ldquo;say no more. The farm is yours, and
      you may, consider yourselves as my tenants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many thanks to you, sir, for the priference. I hope, sir, you&rsquo;ll not rue
      what you did in givin&rsquo; it to us before them that offered a higher rint.
      You&rsquo;ll find, sir, wid the help o&rsquo; the Almighty, that we&rsquo;ll pay you your
      rint rigular an&rsquo; punctual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, thin, long life, an&rsquo; glory, an&rsquo; benedication to your honor! Faith,
      it&rsquo;s only kind father for you, sir, to be what you are. The divil resave
      the family in all Europe&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter, that will do,&rdquo; replied the landlord, &ldquo;it would be rather hazardous
      for our family to compete with all Europe. Go home, Peter, and be guided
      by your wife, who has more sense in her little finger than ever your
      family had either in Europe or out of it, although I mean you no offense
      by going beyond Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all the books that never wor opened an&rsquo; shut,&rdquo; replied Peter, with the
      intuitive quickness of perception peculiar to Irishmen, &ldquo;an innocenter boy
      than Andy Connell never was sent acrass the water. I proved as clear an
      alibi for him as the sun in the firmanent; an&rsquo; yit, bad luck to the
      big-wig O&rsquo;Grady, he should be puttin&rsquo; in his leek an me afore the jury,
      jist whin I had the poor boy cleared out dacently, an&rsquo; wid all honor. An&rsquo; 
      bedad, now, that we&rsquo;re spakin about it, I&rsquo;ll tell your honor the whole
      conclusions of it. You see, sir, the Agint was shot one night; an&rsquo; above
      all nights in the year, your honor, a thief of a toothache that I had kep
      me&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pether, come away, abouchal: his honor kaows as much about it as you do,
      Come, aroon; you know we must help to scald an&rsquo; scrape the pig afore
      night, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s late now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bodad, sir, she&rsquo;s a sweet one, this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be guided by her, Peter, if you&rsquo;re wise, she&rsquo;s a wife you ought to be
      proud of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thrue for you, sir; divil resave the word o&rsquo; lie in that, any how. Come,
      Ellish; come, you deludher, I&rsquo;m wid you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless your honor, sir, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;re ob&rsquo;laged to you for you kindness an&rsquo; 
      patience wid the likes o&rsquo; us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say ditto, your honor. Long life an&rsquo; glory to you every day your honor
      rises!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter, on his way home, entered into a defence of his apology for offering
      so high a rent to the landlord; but although it possessed both ingenuity
      and originality, it was, we must confess, grossly defective in those
      principles usually inculcated by our best Ethic writers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you have tould him what we agreed upon goin&rsquo; up,&rdquo; observed
      Ellish; &ldquo;but instead o&rsquo; that, to begin an&rsquo; tell the gintlemen so many lies
      about your bein&rsquo; dhrunk, an&rsquo; this bein&rsquo; your birth-day, an&rsquo; the day we wor
      marrid, an&rsquo;,&mdash;&mdash;Musha, sich quare stories to come into your
      head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;what harm&rsquo;s in all that, whin he didn&rsquo;t <i>find me
      out?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why the sarra did you go to say that I was in the custom o&rsquo; tellin&rsquo; 
      lies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix, bekase I thought you wor goin&rsquo; to let out all, an&rsquo; I thought it
      best to have the first word o&rsquo; you. What else?&mdash;but sure I brought
      myself off bravely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, a hudh; don&rsquo;t be invintin&rsquo; sich things another time, or
      you&rsquo;ll bring yourself into a scrape, some way or other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix, an&rsquo; you needn&rsquo;t spake, Ellish; you can let out a nate bounce
      yourself, whin it&rsquo;s to sarve you. Come now, don&rsquo;t run away wid the story!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if I do, it&rsquo;s in the way o&rsquo; my business; whin I&rsquo;m batin&rsquo; them down
      in the price o&rsquo; what I&rsquo;m buyin&rsquo;, or gettin&rsquo; thim to bid up for any thing
      I&rsquo;m sellin&rsquo;: besides, it&rsquo;s to advance ourselves in the world that I do it,
      abouchal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go an, go an; faix, you&rsquo;re like the new moon, sharp at both corners: but
      what matther, you beauty, we&rsquo;ve secured the farm, at any rate, an&rsquo;, by
      this an&rsquo; by that, I&rsquo;ll show you tip-top farmin&rsquo; an it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A struggle now commenced between the husband and wife, as to which of them
      should, in their respective departments, advance themselves with greater
      rapidity in life. This friendly contest was kept up principally by the
      address of Ellish, who, as she knew those points in her husband&rsquo;s
      character most easily wrought upon, felt little difficulty in shaping him
      to her own purposes. Her great object was to acquire wealth; and it mostly
      happens, that when this is the ruling principle in life, there is usually
      to be found, in association with it, all those qualities which are best
      adapted to secure it. Peter, on finding that every succeeding day brought
      something to their gains, began to imbibe a portion of that spirit which
      wholly absorbed Ellish. He became worldly; but it was rather the
      worldliness of habit than of principle. In the case of Ellish, it
      proceeded from both; her mind was apt, vigorous, and conceptive; her body
      active, her manners bland and insinuating, and her penetration almost
      intuitive. About the time of their entering upon the second farm, four
      children had been, the fruit of their marriage&mdash;two sons and two
      daughters. These were now new sources of anxiety to their mother, and
      fresh impulses to her industry. Her ignorance, and that of her husband, of
      any kind of education, she had often, in the course of their business,
      bitter cause to regret. She now resolved that their children should be
      well instructed; and no time was lost in sending them to school, the
      moment she thought them capable of imbibing the simplest elements of
      instruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to say,&rdquo; she observed to her husband, &ldquo;how soon they may be
      useful to us. Who knows, Pether, but we may have a full shop yit, an&rsquo; they
      may be able to make up bits of accounts for us, poor things? Throth, I&rsquo;d
      be happy if I wanst seen it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix, Ellish,&rdquo; replied Peter, &ldquo;if we can get an as we&rsquo;re doin&rsquo;, it is
      hard to say. For my own part, if I had got the larnin&rsquo; in time, I might be
      a bright boy to-day, no doubt of it&mdash;could spake up to the best o&rsquo; 
      thim. I never wint to school but wanst, an&rsquo; I remimber I threw the masther
      into a kiln-pot, an&rsquo; broke the poor craythur&rsquo;s arm; an&rsquo; from that day to
      this, I never could be brought a single day to school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter and Ellish now began to be pointed out as a couple worthy of
      imitation by those who knew that perseverance and industry never fail of
      securing their own reward. Others, however,&mdash;that is to say, the
      lazy, the profligate, and the ignorant,&mdash;had a ready solution of the
      secret of their success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear, she&rsquo;s a lucky woman, an&rsquo; anything she puts her hand to
      prospers. Sure sho was born wid a <i>lucky caul</i>* an her head; an&rsquo;, be
      sure, ahagur, the world will flow in upon thim. There&rsquo;s many a neighbor
      about thim works their fingers to the stumps, an&rsquo; yit you see they can&rsquo;t
      get an: for Ellish, if she&rsquo;d throw the sweepins of her hearth to the wind,
      it &lsquo;ud come back to her in money. She was born to it, an&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; can keep
      her from her luck!&rdquo;**
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The caul is a, thin membrane, about the consistence
     of very fine silk, which sometimes covers the head on a
     new-born infant like a cap. It is always the omen of
     great good fortune to the infant and parents; and in
     Ireland, when any one has unexpectedly fallen into the
     receipt of property, or any other temporal good, it is
     customary to say, &ldquo;such a person was born with a &lsquo;lucky
     caul&rsquo; on his head.&rdquo;
 
     Why these are considered lucky, it would be a very
     difficult matter to ascertain. Several instances of
     good fortune, happening to such as were born with them,
     might, by their coincidences, form a basis for the
     superstition; just as the fact of three men during one
     severe winter having been found drowned, each with two
     shirts on, generated an opinion which has now become
     fixed and general in that parish, that it is unlucky to
     wear two shirts at once. We are not certain whether the
     caul is in general the perquisite of the midwife&mdash;
     sometimes we believe it is; at all events, her
     integrity occasionally yields to the desire of
     possessing it. In many cases she conceals its
     existence, in order that she may secretly dispose of it
     to good advantage, which she frequently does; for it is
     considered to be the herald of good fortune to those
     who can get it into their possession. Now, let not our
     English neighbors smile at us for those things until
     they wash their own hands clear of such practices. At
     this day a caul will bring a good price in the most
     civilized city in the world&mdash;to wit, the good city of
     London&mdash;the British metropolis. Nay to such lengths has
     the mania for cauls been carried there, that they have
     been actually advertised for in the Times newspaper.

     * This doctrine of fatalism is very prevalent among the
     lower orders in Ireland.
</pre>
    <p>
      Such are many of the senseless theories that militate against exertion and
      industry in Ireland, and occasion many to shrink back from the laudible
      race of honest enterprise, into filth, penury, and crime. It is this idle
      and envious crew, who, with a natural aversion to domestic industry,
      become adepts in politics, and active in those illegal combinations and
      outrages which retard the prosperity of the country, and bring disgrace
      upon the great body of its peaceable inhabitants.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Ellish was rapidly advancing in life, while such persons
      were absurdly speculating upon the cause of her success. Her business was
      not only increased, but extended. From crockery, herrings, and salt, she
      advanced gradually to deal in other branches adapted to her station, and
      the wants of the people. She bought stockings, and retailed them every
      market-day. By and by a few pieces of soap might be seen in her windows;
      starch, blue, potash, and candles, were equally profitable. Pipes were
      seen stuck across each other, flanked by tape, cakes, children&rsquo;s books,
      thimbles, and bread. In fact, she was equally clever and expert in
      whatever she undertook. The consciousness of this, and the reputation of
      being &ldquo;a hard honest woman,&rdquo; encouraged her to get a cask or two of beer,
      and a few rolls of tobacco. Peter, when she proposed the two last,
      consented only to sell them still as smuggled, goods&mdash;sub silentio.
      With her usual prudence, however, she declined this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have gone on that way purty far,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;an&rsquo; never got a touch,
      (* never suffered by the exciseman) thanks to the kindness o&rsquo; the
      neighbors that never informed an us: but now, Pether, that we&rsquo;re able we
      had betther do everything above boord. You know the ould say, &lsquo;long runs
      the fox, but he&rsquo;s catched at last:&rsquo; so let us give up in time, an&rsquo; get out
      a little bit o&rsquo; license.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that at all,&rdquo; replied Peter: &ldquo;I cain&rsquo;t warm my heart to the
      license. I&rsquo;ll back you in anything but that. The gauger won&rsquo;t come next or
      near us: he has thried it often, an&rsquo; never made anything of it. Dang me,
      but I&rsquo;d like to have a bit o&rsquo; fun with the gauger to see if my hand&rsquo;s
      still ready for practice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thin, Pether, how can you talk that way, asthore? Now if what I&rsquo;m
      sayin&rsquo; was left to yourself wouldn&rsquo;t you be apt to plan it as I&rsquo;m doin&rsquo;?&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t
      you, acushla? Throth, I know you&rsquo;re to cute an&rsquo; sinsible not to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why thin, do you know what, Ellish&mdash;although I didn&rsquo;t spake it out,
      upon my faix I was thinkin&rsquo; of it. Divil a word o&rsquo; lie in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you thief o&rsquo; the world, an&rsquo; never to tell it to me. Faix, Pether,
      you&rsquo;re a cunnin&rsquo; shaver, an&rsquo; as deep as a draw well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me alone. Why I tell you if I study an&rsquo; lay myself down to it, I can
      conthrive anything. When I was young, many a time my poor father, God be
      good to him! said that if there was any possibility of gettin&rsquo; me to take
      to larnin&rsquo;, I&rsquo;d be risin&rsquo; out o&rsquo; the ashes every mornin&rsquo; like a phanix.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But won&rsquo;t you hould to your plan about the license?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hould! To be sure I will. What was I but takin&rsquo; a rise out o&rsquo; you. I
      intinded it this good while, you phanix&mdash;faix, I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In this manner did Ellish dupe her own husband into increasing wealth.
      Their business soon became so extensive, that a larger house was
      absolutely necessary. To leave that, beneath whose roof she succeeded so
      well in all her speculations, was a point&mdash;be it of prudence or of
      prejudice&mdash;which Ellish could not overcome. Her maxim was, whereever
      you find yourself doing well, stay there. She contrived, however, to
      remedy this. To the old house additional apartments were, from time to
      time, added, into which their business soon extended. When these again
      became too small, others were also built; so that in the course of about
      twenty years, their premises were so extensive, that the original
      shebeen-house constituted a very small portion of Peter&rsquo;s residence.
      Peter, during Ellish&rsquo;s progress within doors, had not been idle without.
      For every new room added to the house, he was able to hook in a fresh farm
      in addition to those he had already occupied. Unexpected success had fixed
      his heart so strongly upon the accumulation of money, and the pride of
      rising in the world, as it was possible for a man, to whom they were only
      adventitious feelings, to experience. The points of view in which he and
      his wife were contemplated by the little public about them were peculiar,
      but clearly distinct. The wife was generally esteemed for her talents and
      incessant application to business; but she was not so cordially liked as
      Peter. He, on the other hand, though less esteemed, was more beloved by
      all their acquaintances than Ellish. This might probably originate from
      the more obvious congeniality which existed between Peter&rsquo;s natural
      disposition, and the national character; for with the latter, Ellish,
      except good humor, had little in common.
    </p>
    <p>
      The usual remarks upon both were&mdash;&ldquo;she would buy an&rsquo; sell him&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;twas
      she that made a man of him; but for all that, Pether&rsquo;s worth a ship-load
      of her, if she&rsquo;d give him his own way.&rdquo; That is, if she would permit him
      to drink with the neighbors, to be idle and extravagant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every year, now that their capital was extending, added more perceptibly
      to their independence. Ellish&rsquo;s experience in the humbler kinds of
      business, trained her for a higher line; just as boys at school rise from
      one form to another. She made no plunges, nor permitted Peter, who was
      often, inclined to jump at conclusions, to make any. Her elevation was
      gradual and cautious; for her plans were always so seasonable and simple
      that every new description of business, and every new success, seemed to
      arise naturally from that which went before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having once taken out a license, their house soon became a decent country
      spirit establishment; from soap, and candles, and tobacco, she rose into
      the full sweep of groceries; and from dealing in Connemara stockings and
      tape, she proceeded in due time to sell woollen and linen drapery. Her
      crockery was now metamorphosed into delf, pottery, and hardware; her
      gingerbread into stout loaves, for as Peter himself grew wheat largely,
      she seized the opportunity presented by the death of the only good baker
      in the neighborhood, of opening an extensive bakery.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be asked, how two illiterate persons, like Peter and Ellish, could
      conduct business in which so much calculation was necessary, without
      suffering severely by their liability to make mistakes. To this we reply&mdash;first,
      that we should have liked to see any person attempting to pass a bad note
      or a light guinea upon Ellish after nine or ten years&rsquo; experience; we
      should like to have seen a smug clerk taking his pen from behind his ear,
      and after making his calculation, on inquiring from Ellish if she had
      reckoned up the amount, compelled to ascertain the error which she pointed
      out to him. The most remarkable point in her whole character, was the
      rapid accuracy she displayed in mental calculation, and her uncommon
      sagacity in detecting bad money.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is, however, a still more satisfactory explanation of this
      circumstance to be given. She had not neglected the education of her
      children. The eldest was now an intelligent boy, and a smart accountant,
      who, thanks to his master, had been taught to keep their books by Double
      Entry. The second was little inferior to him as a clerk, though as a
      general dealer he was far his superior. The eldest had been principally
      behind the counter; whilst the younger, in accompanying his mother in all
      her transactions and bargain-making, had in a great measure imbibed her
      address and tact.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is certainly a pleasing, and, we think, an interesting thing, to
      contemplate the enterprise of an humble, but active, shrewd woman,
      enabling her to rise, step by step, from the lowest state of poverty to a
      small sense of independence; from this, by calling-fresh powers into
      action, taking wider views, and following them up by increased efforts,
      until her shebeen becomes a small country public-house; until her roll of
      tobacco, and her few pounds of soap and starch, are lost in the
      well-filled drawers of a grocery shop; and her gray Connemara stockings
      transformed by the golden wand of industry into a country cloth warehouse.
      To see Peter&mdash;from the time when he first harrowed part of his farm
      with a thorn-bush, and ploughed it by joining his horse to that of a
      neighbor&mdash;adding farm to farm, horse to horse, and cart to cart,
      until we find him a wealthy and extensive agriculturist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The progress of Peter and Ellish was in another point of view a good study
      for him who wishes to look into human nature, whilst adapting itself to
      the circumstances through which it passes. When this couple began life,
      their friends and acquaintancess were as poor as themselves; as they
      advanced from one gradation to another, and rose up from a lower to a
      higher state, their former friends, who remained in their original
      poverty, found themselves left behind in cordiality and intimacy, as well
      as in circumstances; whilst the subjects of our sketch continued to make
      new friendships of a more respectable stamp, to fill up, as it were, the
      places held in their good will by their humble, but neglected, intimates.
      Let not our readers, however, condemn them for this.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the act of society, and not of Peter and Ellish. On their parts, it
      was involuntary; their circumstances raised them, and they were compelled,
      of course, to rise with their circumstances. They were passing through the
      journey of life, as it were, and those with whom they set out, not having
      been able to keep up with them, soon lost their companionship, which was
      given to those with whom they travelled for the time being. Society is
      always ready to reward the enterprising and industrious by its just
      honors, whether they are sought or not; it is so disposed, that every man
      falls or rises into his proper place in it, and that by the wisdom and
      harmony of its structure. The rake, who dissipates by profligacy and
      extravagance that which might have secured him an honorable place in life,
      is eventually brought to the work-house; whilst the active citizen, who
      realizes an honest independence, is viewed with honor and esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter and Ellish were now people of consequence in the parish; the former
      had ceased to do anything more than superintend the cultivation of his
      farms; the latter still took an active part in her own business, or rather
      in the various departments of business Which she carried on. Peter might
      be seen the first man abroad in the morning proceeding to some of his
      farms mounted upon a good horse, comfortably dressed in top boots, stout
      corduroy breeches, buff cashmere waistcoat, and blue broad-cloth coat, to
      which in winter was added a strong frieze greatcoat, with a drab velvet
      collar, and a glazed hat. Ellish was also respectably dressed, but still
      considerably under her circumstances. Her mode of travelling to fairs or
      markets was either upon a common car, covered with a feather-bed and
      quilt, or behind Peter upon a pillion. This last method flattered Peter&rsquo;s
      vanity very much; no man could ride on these occasions with a statelier
      air. He kept himself as erect and stiff as a poker, and brandished the
      thong of his loaded whip with the pride of a gentleman farmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tis true, he did not always hear the sarcastic remarks which were passed
      upon him by those who witnessed his good-natured vanity:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he goes,&rdquo; some laboring man on the wayside would exclaim, &ldquo;a
      purse-proud <i>bodagh</i> upon our hands. Why, thin, does he forget that
      we remimber when he kept the shebeen-house, an&rsquo; sould his smuggled
      to-baccy in gits (* the smallest possible quantities) out of his pocket,
      for fraid o&rsquo; the gauger! Sowl, he&rsquo;d show a blue nose, any way, only for
      the wife&mdash;&lsquo;Twas she made a man of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, an&rsquo; I for one, won&rsquo;t hear Pether Connell run down,&rdquo; his companion
      would reply; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a good-hearted, honest man, an&rsquo; obligin&rsquo; enough; an&rsquo; 
      for that matter so is the wife, a hard honest woman, that made what they
      have, an&rsquo; brought herself an&rsquo; her husband from nothin&rsquo; to somethin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thrue for you, Tim; in throth, they do desarve credit. Still, you see,
      here&rsquo;s you an&rsquo; me, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ve both been slavin&rsquo; ourselves as much as they
      have, an&rsquo; yet you see how we are! However, <i>its their luck</i>, and
      there&rsquo;s no use in begrudgin&rsquo; it to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When their children were full-grown, the mother did not, as might have
      been supposed, prevent them from making a respectable appearance. With
      excellent judgment, she tempered their dress, circumstances, and prospects
      so well together, that the family presented an admirable display of
      economy, and a decent sense of independence. From the moment they were
      able to furnish solid proofs of their ability to give a comfortable dinner
      occasionally, the priest of the parish began to notice them; and this new
      intimacy, warmed by the honor conferred on one side, and by the good
      dinners on the other, ripened into a strong friendship. For many a long
      year, neither Peter nor Ellish, God forgive them, ever troubled themselves
      about going to their duty. They soon became, however, persons of too much
      importance to be damned without an effort made for their salvation. The
      worthy gentleman accordingly addressed them on the subject, and as the
      matter was one of perfect indifference to both, they had not the slightest
      hesitation to go to confession&mdash;in compliment to the priest. We do
      not blame the priest for this; God forbid that we should quarrel with a
      man for loving a good dinner. If we ourselves were a priest, it is very
      probable,&mdash;nay, from the zest with which we approach a good dinner,
      it is quite certain&mdash;that we would have cultivated honest Peter&rsquo;s
      acquaintance, and drawn him out to the practice of that most social of
      virtues&mdash;hospitality. The salvation of such a man&rsquo;s soul was worth
      looking after; and, indeed, we find a much warmer interest felt, in all
      churches, for those who are able to give good dinners, than for those poor
      miserable sinners who can scarcely get even a bad one.
    </p>
    <p>
      But besides this, there was another reason for the Rev. Mr. Mulcahy&rsquo;s
      anxiety to cultivate a friendship with Peter and his wife&mdash;which
      reason consisted in a very laudable determination to bring about a match
      between his own niece, Miss Granua Mulcahy, and Peter&rsquo;s eldest son, Dan.
      This speculation he had not yet broached to the family, except by broken
      hints, and jocular allusions to the very flattering proposals that had
      been made by many substantial young men for Miss Granua.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time the wealth of the Connells had accumulated to thousands;
      their business in the linen and woollen drapery line was incredible. There
      was scarcely a gentleman within many miles of them, who did not find it
      his interest to give them his custom. In the hardware, flour, and baking
      concerns they were equally fortunate. The report of their wealth had gone
      far and near, exaggerated, however, as everything of the kind is certain
      to be; but still there were ample grounds for estimating it at a very high
      amount.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their stores were large, and well filled with many a valuable bale; their
      cellars well stocked with every description of spirits; and their shop,
      though not large in proportion to their transactions, was well filled,
      neat, and tastefully fitted up. There was no show, however&mdash;no empty
      glare to catch the eye; on the contrary, the whole concern was marked by
      an air of solid, warm comfort, that was much more indicative of wealth and
      independence than tawdry embellishment would have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Avourneen,&rdquo; said Ellish, &ldquo;the way to deck out your shop is to keep the
      best of goods. Wanst the people knows that they&rsquo;ll get betther money-worth
      here than they&rsquo;ll get anywhere else, they&rsquo;ll come here, whether the shop
      looks well or ill. Not savin&rsquo; but every shop ought to be clane an&rsquo; dacent,
      for there&rsquo;s rason in all things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, indeed, was another secret of their success. Every article in their
      shop was of the best description, having been selected by Ellish&rsquo;s own eye
      and hand in the metropolis, or imported directly from the place of its
      manufacture. Her periodical visits to Dublin gave her great satisfaction;
      for it appears that those with whom she dealt, having had sufficient
      discrimination to appreciate her talents and integrity, treated her with
      marked respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter&rsquo;s farm-yard bore much greater evidence of his wealth than did
      Ellish&rsquo;s shop. It was certainly surprising to reflect, that by the
      capacity of two illiterate persons, who began the world with nothing, all
      the best and latest improvements in farming were either adopted or
      anticipated. The farmyard was upon a great scale; for Peter cultivated no
      less than four hundred acres of land&mdash;to such lengths had his
      enterprise carried him. Threshing machines, large barns, corn kilns, large
      stacks, extensive stables, and immense cow-houses, together with the
      incessant din of active employment perpetually going on&mdash;all gave a
      very high opinion of their great prosperity, and certainly reflected honor
      upon those whose exertions had created such a scene about them. One would
      naturally suppose, when the family of the Connells had arrived to such
      unexpected riches, and found it necessary to conduct a system whose
      machinery was so complicated and extensive that Ellish would have fallen
      back to the simple details of business, from a deficiency of that
      comprehensive intelligence which is requisite to conduct the higher order
      of mercantile transactions; especially as her sons were admirably
      qualified by practice, example, and education, to ease her of a task which
      would appear one of too much difficulty for an unlettered farmer&rsquo;s wife.
      Such a supposition would be injurious to this excellent woman. So far from
      this being the case, she was still the moving spirit, the chief conductor
      of the establishment. Whenever any difficulty arose that required an
      effort of ingenuity and sagacity, she was able in the homeliest words to
      disentangle it so happily, that those who heard her wondered that it
      should at all have appeared to them as a difficulty. She was everywhere.
      In Peter&rsquo;s farm-yard her advice was as excellent and as useful as in her
      own shop. On his farms she was the better agriculturist, and she
      frequently set him right in his plans and speculations for the ensuing
      year.
    </p>
    <p>
      She herself was not ignorant of her skill. Many a time has she surveyed
      the scene about her with an eye in which something like conscious pride
      might be seen to kindle. On those occasions she usually shook her head,
      and exclaimed, either in soliloquy, or by way of dialogue, to some person
      near her:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, avourneen, all&rsquo;s very right, an&rsquo; goin&rsquo; an bravely; but I only hope
      that when I&rsquo;m gone I won&rsquo;t be missed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Missed,&rdquo; Peter would reply, if he happened to hear her; &ldquo;oh, upon my
      credit&rdquo;&mdash;he was a man of too much consequence to swear &ldquo;by this and
      by that&rdquo; now&mdash;&ldquo;upon my credit, Ellish, if you die soon, you&rsquo;ll see
      the genteel wife I&rsquo;ll have in your place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whisht, avourneen! Although you&rsquo;re but jokin&rsquo;, I don&rsquo;t like to hear it,
      avillish! No, indeed; we wor too long together, Pether, and lived too
      happily wid one another, for you to have the heart to think of sich a
      thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, in troth, Ellish, I would be long sarry to do it. It&rsquo;s displasin&rsquo; to
      you, achree, an&rsquo; I won&rsquo;t say it. God spare you to us! It was you put the
      bone in us, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s what all the country says, big an&rsquo; little, young
      and ould; an&rsquo; God He knows it&rsquo;s truth, and nothin&rsquo; else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, no, thin, Pether, it&rsquo;s not altogether thruth, you desarve your
      full share of it. You backed me well, acushla, in everything, an&rsquo; if you
      had been a dhrinkin&rsquo;, idle, rollikin&rsquo; vagabone, what &lsquo;ud signify all, that
      me or the likes o&rsquo; me could do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, an&rsquo; it was you made me what I am, Ellish; you tuck the soft side
      o&rsquo; me, you beauty; an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s well you did, for by this&mdash;hem, upon my
      reputation, if you had gone to cross purposes with me you&rsquo;d find yourself
      in the wrong box. An&rsquo;, you phanix of beauty, you managed the childhre, the
      crathurs, the same way&mdash;an&rsquo; a good way it is, in throth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pether, wor you ever thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; Father Muloahy&rsquo;s sweetness to us of
      late?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thin, the sorra one o&rsquo; me thought of it. Why, Ellish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you obsarve that for the last three or four months he&rsquo;s full of
      attintions to us? Every Sunday he brings you up, an&rsquo; me, if I&rsquo;d go, to the
      althar,&mdash;an&rsquo; keeps you there by way of showin&rsquo; you respect. Pether,
      it&rsquo;s not you, but your money he respects; an&rsquo; I think there ought to be no
      respect o&rsquo; persons in the chapel, any how. You&rsquo;re not a bit nearer God by
      bein&rsquo; near the althar; for how do we know but the poorest crathur there is
      nearer to heaven than we are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, sure enough, Ellish; but what deep skame are you penethratin&rsquo; now,
      you desaver?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d lay my life, you&rsquo;ll have a proposial o&rsquo; marriage from Father Mulcahy,
      atween our Dan an&rsquo; Miss Granua. For many a day he&rsquo;s hintin&rsquo; to us, from
      time to time, about the great offers she had; now what&rsquo;s the rason, if she
      had these great offers, that he didn&rsquo;t take them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bedad, Ellish, you&rsquo;re the greatest headpiece in all Europe. Murdher
      alive, woman, what a fine counsellor you&rsquo;d make. An&rsquo; suppose he did offer,
      Ellish, what &lsquo;ud you be sayin&rsquo; to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that &lsquo;ud depind entirely upon what he&rsquo;s able to give her&mdash;they
      say he has money. It &lsquo;ud depind, too, upon whether Dan has any likin&rsquo; for
      her or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s often wid her, I know; an&rsquo; I needn&rsquo;t tell you, Ellish, that afore we
      wor spliced together, I was often wid somebody that I won&rsquo;t mintion. At
      all evints, he has made Dan put the big O afore the Connell, so that he
      has him now full namesake to the Counsellor; an&rsquo;, faith, that itself&rsquo; &lsquo;ud
      get him a wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the best way is to say nothin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; to hear nothin&rsquo;, till his
      Reverence spates out, an&rsquo; thin we&rsquo;ll see what can be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellish&rsquo;s sagacity had not misled her. In a few months afterwards Father
      Mulcahy was asked by young Dan Connell to dine; and as he and holiest
      Ellish were sitting together, in the course of the evening, the priest
      broached the topic as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Connell, I think this whiskey is better than my four-year old, that
      I bought at the auction the other day, although Dan says mine&rsquo;s better.
      Between ourselves, that Dan is a clever, talented young fellow; and if he
      happens upon a steady, sensible wife, there is no doubt but he will die a
      respectable man. But, by the by, Mrs. Connell, you&rsquo;ve never tried my
      whiskey; and upon my credit, you must soon, for I know your opinion would
      decide the question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it worth while to decide it, your Reverence? I suppose the thruth is,
      sir, that both is good enough for anyone; an&rsquo; I think that&rsquo;s as much as we
      want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus far she went, but never alluded to Dan, judiciously throwing the onus
      of introducing that subject upon the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dan says mine&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; observed Father Mulcahy; &ldquo;and I would certainly
      give a great deal for his opinion upon that or any other subject, except
      theology.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought,&rdquo; replied Ellish, &ldquo;to be a bether judge of whiskey nor either
      Dan nor me; an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll tell you why&mdash;you dhrink it in more places, and
      can make comparishment one wid another; but Dan an&rsquo; me is confined mostly
      to our own, an&rsquo; of that same we take very little, an&rsquo; the less the betther
      for people in business, or indeed for anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true, Mrs. Connell! But for all that, I won&rsquo;t give up Dan&rsquo;s judgment
      in anything within his own line of business, still excepting theology, for
      which, he hasn&rsquo;t the learning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good son, without <i>tay</i>ology&mdash;as good as ever broke the
      world&rsquo;s bread,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;glory be to God! Although, for that matther,
      he ought to be as well acquainted wid <i>tay</i>ology as your Reverence,
      in regard that he <i>sells</i> more of it nor you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good son, they say, Mrs. Connell, will make a good husband. I wonder
      you don&rsquo;t think of settling him in life. It&rsquo;s full time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, avourneen, we must lave that wid himself. I needn&rsquo;t be tellin&rsquo; 
      you, that it &lsquo;ud be hard to find a girl able to bring what the girl that
      &lsquo;ud expect Dan ought to bring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a staggerer to the priest, who recruited his ingenuity by
      drinking Peter&rsquo;s health, and Ellish&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you nobody in your eye for him, Mrs. Connell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, I&rsquo;ll engage she has,&rdquo; replied Peter, with a ludicrous grin&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      venture for to say she has that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very right, Mrs. Connell; it&rsquo;s all fair. Might one ask who she is; for,
      to tell you the truth, Dan is a favorite of mine, and must make it a point
      to see him well settled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, your Reverence,&rdquo; replied Peter again, &ldquo;jist the one you mintioned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? I? Why I mentioned nobody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; that&rsquo;s the very one she has in her eye for him, plase your Reverence&mdash;ha,
      ha, ha! What&rsquo;s the world widout a joke, Docthor? beggin&rsquo; your pardon for
      makin&rsquo; so free wid you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter, you&rsquo;re still a wag,&rdquo; replied the priest; &ldquo;but, seriously, Mrs.
      Connell, have you selected any female, of respectable connections, as a
      likely person to be a wife for Dan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed no, your Reverence, I have not. Where could I pitch upon a girl&mdash;barrin&rsquo; 
      a Protestant, an&rsquo; that &lsquo;ud never do&mdash;who has a fortune to meet what
      Dan&rsquo;s to get?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest moved his chair a little, and drank their healths a second
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know, Mrs. Connell, that Dan needn&rsquo;t care so much about fortune,
      if he got a girl of respectable connections. He has an independence
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thrue for you, father; but what right would any girl have to expect to be
      supported by the hard arnin&rsquo; of me an&rsquo; my husband, widout bringin&rsquo; 
      somethin&rsquo; forrid herself? You know, sir, that the fortune always goes wid
      the wife; but am I to fortune off my son to a girl that has nothin&rsquo;? If my
      son, plase your Reverence, hadn&rsquo;t a coat to his back, or a guinea in his
      pocket&mdash;as, God be praised, he has both&mdash;but, supposin&rsquo; he
      hadn&rsquo;t, what right would he have to expect a girl wid a handsome fortune
      to marry him? There&rsquo;s Paddy Neil your sarvint-boy; now, if Paddy, who&rsquo;s an
      honest man&rsquo;s son, axed your niece, wouldn&rsquo;t you be apt to lose your
      timper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Mrs. Connell, I think your fire&rsquo;s rather hot&mdash;allow
      me to drawback a little. Mrs. Connell, your health again!&mdash;Mr.
      Connell, your fireside!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Docthor; but faith I think you ought hardly to dhrink the same
      fireside, becase it appears to be rather hot for your Reverence, at the
      present time&mdash;ha, ha, ha! Jokin&rsquo; still, Docthor, we must be. Well,
      what harm! I wish we may never do worse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what fortune would you expect with a girl of genteel connexion&mdash;a
      girl that&rsquo;s accomplished, well say in music, plain work, and Irish,
      vernacularly?&mdash;hem! What fortune would you be expecting with such a
      girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Docthor, ahagur, the only music I&rsquo;d wish for my son&rsquo;s wife is a good
      timper; an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s what their music-masthers can&rsquo;t tache thim. The plain
      work, although I don&rsquo;t know what you mane by it, sounds well enough; an&rsquo; 
      as to Irish, whick-whacku-larly, if you mane our own ould tongue, he may
      get thousands that can spake it whackinly, an&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a wealthy woman, certainly, Mrs. Connell, and what&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;m not
      at all surprised at it. Your health, once more, and long life to you!
      Suppose, however, that Dan got a fitting wife, what would you expect as a
      proper portion? I have a reason for asking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dan, plase your Reverence, will get four thousand to begin the world wid;
      an&rsquo;, as he&rsquo;s to expect none but a Catholic, I suppose if he gets the
      fourth part of that, it&rsquo;s as much as he ought to look for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand pounds!&mdash;hut tut! The woman&rsquo;s beside herself. Why look
      about you and try where you can find a Catholic girl with a thousand
      pounds fortune, except in a gentleman&rsquo;s family, where Dan could never
      think of going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s thrue, any how, your Reverence,&rdquo; observed Peter.&mdash;&ldquo;A thousand
      pounds! Ellish! you needn&rsquo;t look for it. Where is it to be had out of a
      gintleman&rsquo;s family, as his Reverence says thrue enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; now, Docthor,&rdquo; said Ellish, &ldquo;what &lsquo;ud you think a girl ought to bring
      a young man like Dan, that&rsquo;s to have four thousand pounds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think any Catholic girl of his own rank in the county, could get
      more than a couple of hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one shillin&rsquo; to every pound he has,&rdquo; replied Ellish, almost
      instantaneously. &ldquo;But, Father, you may as well spake out at wanst,&rdquo; she
      continued, for she was too quick and direct in all her dealings to be
      annoyed by circumlocution; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re desairous of a match between Dan an&rsquo; 
      Miss Granua?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said the priest; &ldquo;and what is more, I believe they are fond of
      each other. I know Dan is attached to her, for he told me so. But, now
      that we have mentioned her, I say that there is not a more accomplished
      girl of her persuasion in the parish we sit in. She can play on the
      bagpipes better than any other piper in the province, for I taught her
      myself; and I tell you that in a respectable man&rsquo;s wife a knowledge of
      music is a desirable thing. It&rsquo;s hard to tell, Mrs. Connell, how they may
      rise in the World, and get into fashionable company, so that
      accomplishments, you persave, are good, she can make a shirt and wash it,
      and she can write Irish. As for dancing, I only wish you&rsquo;d see her at a
      hornpipe. All these things put together, along with her genteel
      connections, and the prospect of what I may be able to lave her&mdash;I
      say your son may do worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not what you&rsquo;d lave her, sir, but what you&rsquo;d give her in the first
      place, that I&rsquo;d like to hear. Spake up, your Reverence, an&rsquo; let us know
      how far you will go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afeard, sir,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;if it goes to a clane bargain atween yez,
      that Ellish will make you bid up for Dan. Be sharp; sir, or you&rsquo;ll have no
      chance; faix, you won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Mrs. Connell;&rdquo; replied the priest, &ldquo;before I spake up, consider her
      accomplishments. I&rsquo;ll undertake to say, that the best bred girl in Dublin
      cannot perform music in such style, or on such an instrument as the one
      she uses. Let us contemplate Dan and her after marriage, in an elegant
      house, and full business, the dinner over, and they gone up to the
      drawing-room. Think how agreeable and graceful it would be for Mrs. Daniel
      O&rsquo;Connell to repair to the sofa, among a few respectable friends, and,
      taking up her bagpipes, set her elbow a-going, until the drone gives two
      or three broken groans, and the chanter a squeak or two, like a child in
      the cholic, or a cat that you had trampled on by accident. Then comes the
      real ould Irish music, that warms the heart. Dan looks upon her graceful
      position, until the tears of love, taste, and admiration are coming down
      his cheeks. By and by, the toe of him moves: here another foot is going;
      and, in no time, there is a hearty dance, with a light heart and a good
      conscience. You or I, perhaps, drop in to see them, and, of course, we
      partake of the enjoyment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divil a pleasanter,&rdquo; said Peter: &ldquo;I tell you, I&rsquo;d like it well; an&rsquo;, for
      my own part, if the deludher here has no objection, I&rsquo;m not goin&rsquo; to spoil
      sport.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellish looked hard at the priest; her keen blue eye glittered with a
      sparkling light, that gave decided proofs of her sagacity being intensely
      excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that you&rsquo;ve said,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;is very fine; but in regard o&rsquo; the
      bag-pipes, an&rsquo; Miss Granua Mulcahy&rsquo;s squeezin&rsquo; the music out o&rsquo; thim&mdash;why,
      if it plased God to bring my son to the staff an&rsquo; bag&mdash;a common
      beggar&mdash;indeed, in that case, Miss Granua&rsquo;s bagpipes might sarve both
      o&rsquo; thim, an&rsquo; help, maybe, to get them a night&rsquo;s lodgin&rsquo; or so; but until
      that time comes, if you respect your niece, you&rsquo;ll burn her bagpipes,
      dhrone, chanther, an&rsquo; all. If you are for a match, which I doubt, spake
      out, as I said, and say what fortune you&rsquo;ll pay down on the nail wid her,
      otherwise we&rsquo;re losin&rsquo; our time, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s a loss one can&rsquo;t make up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest, who thought he could have bantered Ellish into an alliance,
      without pledging himself to pay any specific fortune, found that it was
      necessary for him to treat the matter seriously, if he expected to
      succeed. He was certainly anxious for the match; and as he really wished
      to see his niece&mdash;who, in truth, was an excellent girl, and handsome&mdash;well
      settled, he resolved to make a stretch and secure Dan if possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Connell,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will be brief with you. The most I can give
      her is three hundred pounds, and even that by struggling and borrowing: I
      will undertake to pay it as you say&mdash;on the nail! for I am really
      anxious that my niece should be connected with so worthy and industrious a
      family. What do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m willin&rsquo; enough,&rdquo; replied Peter. It&rsquo;s not asy to get that and a
      Catholic girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some thruth in what you say, aroon, sure enough,&rdquo; observed
      Ellish; &ldquo;an&rsquo; if his Reverence puts another hundhre to it, why, in the name
      of goodness, let them go together. If you don&rsquo;t choose that, Docthor,
      never breathe the subject to me agin. Dan&rsquo;s not an ould man yit, an&rsquo; has
      time enough to get wives in plenty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; replied the priest, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s my hand, it&rsquo;s a bargain; although I
      must say there&rsquo;s no removing you from your point. I will give four
      hundred, hook or crook; but I&rsquo;ll have sad scrambling to get it together.
      Still I&rsquo;ll make it good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down on the nail?&rdquo; inquired Ellish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay! ay! Down on the nail,&rdquo; replied the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in the name o&rsquo; Goodness, a bargain be it,&rdquo; said Peter; &ldquo;but, upon
      my credit, Ellish, I won&rsquo;t have the bag-pipes burnt, anyhow. Faith, I must
      hear an odd tune, now an&rsquo; thin, when I call to see the childhre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pether, acushla, have sinse. Would you wish to see your daughter-in-law
      playin&rsquo; upon the bag-pipes, when she ought to be mindin&rsquo; her business, or
      attendin&rsquo; her childhre? No, your Reverence, the pipes must be laid aside.
      I&rsquo;ll have no pipery connection for a son of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest consented to this, although Peter conceded it with great
      reluctance. Further preliminaries were agreed upon, and the evening passed
      pleasantly, until it became necessary for Mr. Mulcahy to bid them
      good-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were gone, Peter and Ellish talked over the matter between
      themselves in the following dialogue:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fortune&rsquo;s a small one,&rdquo; said Ellish to her husband; &ldquo;an&rsquo; I suppose
      you wondher that I consinted to take so little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure enough, I wondhered at it,&rdquo; replied Peter, &ldquo;but, for my own part,
      I&rsquo;d give my son to her widout a penny o&rsquo; fortune, in ordher to be
      connected wid the priest; an&rsquo; besides, she&rsquo;s a fine, handsome, good girl&mdash;ay,
      an&rsquo; his fill of a wife, if she had but the shift to her back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four hundhre wid a priest&rsquo;s niece, Pether, is before double the money wid
      any other. Don&rsquo;t you know, that when they set up for themselves, he can
      bring the custom of the whole parish to them? It&rsquo;s unknown the number o&rsquo; 
      ways he can sarve them in. Sure, at stations an&rsquo; weddins, wakes,
      marriages, and funerals, they&rsquo;ll all be proud to let the priest know that
      they purchased whatever they wanted from his niece an&rsquo; her husband.
      Betther!&mdash;faix, four hundhre from him is worth three times as much
      from another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glory to you, Ellish!&mdash;bright an&rsquo; cute for ever! Why, I&rsquo;d back you
      for a woman&rsquo; that could buy an&rsquo; sell Europe, aginst the world. Now, isn&rsquo;t
      it odd that I never think of these long-headed skames?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay do you, often enough, Pether; but you keep them to yourself,
      abouchal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, I&rsquo;m close, no doubt of it; an&rsquo;&mdash;but there&rsquo;s no use in sayin&rsquo; 
      any more about it&mdash;you said whatsomever came into my own head
      consarnin&rsquo; it. Faith, you did, you phanix.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a short time the marriage took place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan, under the advice of his mother, purchased a piece of ground most
      advantageously located, as the site of a mill, whereon an excellent one
      was built; and as a good mill had been long a desideratum in the country,
      his success was far beyond his expectations. Every speculation, in fact,
      which Ellish touched, prospered. Fortune seemed to take delight, either in
      accomplishing or anticipating her wishes. At least, such was the general
      opinion, although nothing could possibly be more erroneous than to
      attribute her success to mere chance. The secret of all might be ascribed
      to her good sense, and her exact knowledge of the precise moment when to
      take the tide of fortune at its flow. Her son, in addition to the mill,
      opened an extensive mercantile establishment in the next town, where he
      had ample cause to bless the instructions of his mother, and her foresight
      in calculating upon the advantage of being married to the priest&rsquo;s niece.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after his marriage, the person who had for many years kept the head
      inn of the next town died, and the establishment was advertised for sale.
      Ellish was immediately in action. Here was an opportunity of establishing
      the second son in a situation which had enabled the late proprietor of it
      to die nearly the richest man in the parish. A few days, therefore, before
      that specified for the sale, she took her featherbed car, and had an
      interview with the executors of the late proprietor. Her character was
      known, her judgment and integrity duly estimated, and, perhaps, what was
      the weightiest argument in her favor, her purse was forthcoming to
      complete the offer she had made. After some private conversation between
      the executors, her proposal was accepted, and before she returned home,
      the head inn, together with its fixtures and furniture, was her property.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second son, who was called after his father, received the intelligence
      with delight. One of his sisters was, at his mother&rsquo;s suggestion,
      appointed to conduct the housekeeping department, and keep the bar, a duty
      for which she was pretty well qualified by her experience at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will paint it in great style,&rdquo; said Peter the Younger. &ldquo;It must be a
      head Inn no longer; I&rsquo;ll call it a Hotel, for that&rsquo;s the whole fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wants little, avourneen,&rdquo; said his mother; &ldquo;it was well kept&mdash;some
      paintin&rsquo; an other improvements it does want, but don&rsquo;t be extravagant.
      Have it clane an&rsquo; dacent, but, above all things, comfortable, an&rsquo; the
      attindance good. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;ll carry you, an&mdash;not a flourish o&rsquo; 
      paintin&rsquo; outside, an&rsquo; dirt, an&rsquo; confusion, an&rsquo; bad attindance widin.
      Considher, Pether darlin&rsquo;, that the man who owned it last, feathered his
      nest well in it, but never called it a Hotill. Let it appear on the
      outside jist as your old customers used to see it; but improve it widin as
      much as you can, widout bein&rsquo; lavish an it, or takin&rsquo; up the place wid
      nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all evints, I&rsquo;ll have a picture of the Liberator over the door, an&rsquo; 
      O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo; written under it. It&rsquo;s both our names, and besides it will be
      &lsquo;killin&rsquo; two birds with one stone.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, avourneen. Let me advise you, if you wish to prosper in life, to keep
      yourself out of party-work. It only stands betune you an&rsquo; your business;
      an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s surely wiser for you to mind your own affairs than the affairs of
      the nation. There&rsquo;s rason in everything. No man in trade has a right,
      widout committin&rsquo; a sin, to neglect his family for politics or parties.
      There&rsquo;s Jack Cummins that was doin&rsquo; well in his groceries till he began to
      make speeches, an&rsquo; get up public meetins, an&rsquo; write petitions, an&rsquo; now he
      has nothin&rsquo; to throuble him but politics, for his business is gone. Every
      one has liberty to think as they plase. We can&rsquo;t expect Protestants to
      think as we do, nor Protestants can&rsquo;t suppose that we ought to think as
      they&rsquo;d wish; an&rsquo; for that same rason, we should make allowance on both
      sides, an&rsquo; not be like many we know, that have their minds up, expectin&rsquo; 
      they don&rsquo;t know, what, instead of workin&rsquo; for themselves and their
      families as they ought to do. Pether, won&rsquo;t you give that up, avillish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re right, mother. I didn&rsquo;t see it before in the light
      you&rsquo;ve placed it in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, Pether darlin&rsquo;, lose no time in gettin&rsquo; into your place&mdash;you
      an&rsquo; Alley; an&rsquo; faix, if you don&rsquo;t both manage it cleverly, I&rsquo;ll never
      spake to yez.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here was a second son settled, and nothing remained but to dispose of
      their two daughters in marriage to the best and most advantageous offers.
      This, in consequences of their large fortunes, was not a matter of much
      difficulty. The eldest, Alley, who assisted her brother to conduct the
      Inn, became the wife of an extensive grazier, who lived in an adjoining
      county. The younger, Mary, was joined to Father Mulcahy&rsquo;s nephew, not
      altogether to the satisfaction of the mother, who feared that two
      establishments of the same kind, in the same parish, supported by the same
      patronage, must thrive at the expense of each other. As it was something
      of a love-match, however, she ultimately consented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Avourneen,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;the parish is big enough, an&rsquo; has customers enough
      to support two o&rsquo; them; an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll engage his Reverence will do what he can
      for them both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, neither she nor her husband was dependent upon their
      children. Peter still kept the agricultural department in operation; and
      although the shop and warehouse were transferred to Mr. Mulcahy, in right
      of his wife, yet it was under the condition of paying a yearly sum to Mrs.
      Connell and her husband, ostensibly as a provision, but really as a spur
      to their exertions. A provision they could not want, for their wealth
      still amounted to thousands, independently of the large annual profits
      arising out of their farms.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time after the marriage of her youngest daughter, Mrs. Connell
      took a very active part in her son-in-law&rsquo;s affairs. He possessed neither
      experience, nor any knowledge of business whatsoever, though he was not
      deficient in education, nor in capacity to acquire both. This pleased Mrs.
      Connell very much, who set herself to the task of instructing him in the
      principles of commercial life, and in the best methods of transacting
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first rules,&rdquo; said she to him, &ldquo;for you to obsarve is these: tell
      truth; be sober; be punctual; rise early; persavere; avoid extravagance;
      keep your word; an watch your health. Next: don&rsquo;t be proud; give no
      offince; talk sweetly; be ready to oblage, when you can do it widout
      inconvanience, but don&rsquo;t put yourself or your business out o&rsquo; your ways to
      sarve anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirdly: keep an appearance of substance an&rsquo; comfort about your place,
      but don&rsquo;t go beyant your manes in doin&rsquo; it; when you make a bargain, think
      what a corrocther them you dale wid bears, an&rsquo; whether or not you found
      them honest before, if you ever had business wid them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you buy a thing, appear to know your own mind, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t be hummin&rsquo; 
      an&rsquo; hawin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; higglin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; longin&rsquo; as if your teeth wor watherin&rsquo; 
      afther it; but be manly, downright, an&rsquo; quick; they&rsquo;ll then see that you
      know your business, an&rsquo; they won&rsquo;t be keepin&rsquo; off an&rsquo; an, but will close
      wid you at wanst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never drink at bargain makin&rsquo;; an&rsquo; never pay money in a public-house if
      you can help it; if you must do it, go into an inn, or a house that you
      know to be dacent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never stay out late in a fair or market; don&rsquo;t make a poor mouth; on the
      other hand, don&rsquo;t boast of your wealth; keep no low company; don&rsquo;t be
      rubbin&rsquo; yourself against your betthers, but keep wid your aquils. File
      your loose papers an&rsquo; accounts, an&rsquo; keep your books up to the day. Never
      put off anything that can be done, when it ought to be done. Go early to
      bed; but be the last up at night, and the first in the mornin&rsquo;, and
      there&rsquo;s no fear o&rsquo; you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having now settled all her children in comfort and independence, with each
      a prospect of rising still higher in the world, Mrs. Connell felt that the
      principal duties devolving upon her had been discharged. It was but
      reasonable, she thought, that, after the toil of a busy life, her husband
      and herself should relax a little, and enjoy with lighter minds the ease
      for which they had labored so long and unremittingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; of, Pether?&rdquo; said she, one summer evening
      in their farm-yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know, is it?&rdquo; replied Peter&mdash;&ldquo;some long-headed plan that none of us
      &lsquo;ud ever think of, but that will stare us in the face the moment you
      mintion it. What is it, you ould sprig o&rsquo; beauty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, to get a snug jauntin&rsquo;-car, for you an&rsquo; me. I&rsquo;d like to see you
      comfortable in your old days, Peter. You&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; stiff, ahagur, an&rsquo; 
      will be good for nothin&rsquo; by an&rsquo; by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stiff! Arrah, by this an&rsquo; by&mdash;my reputation, I&rsquo;m younger nor e&rsquo;er a
      one o&rsquo; my sons yet, you&mdash;&mdash;eh?&rdquo; said Peter, pausing&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, then I dunna that. Upon my credit, I think, on second thoughts,
      that a car &lsquo;ud be a mighty comfortable thing for me. Faith, I do, an&rsquo; for
      you, too, Ellish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The common car,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;is slow and throublesome, an&rsquo; joults the
      life out o&rsquo; me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my reputation, you&rsquo;re not the same woman since you began to use it,
      that you wor before at all. Why, it&rsquo;ll shorten your life. The pillion&rsquo;s
      dacent enough; but the jauntin&rsquo;-car!&mdash;faix, it&rsquo;s what &lsquo;ud make a
      fresh woman o&rsquo; you&mdash;divil a lie in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not puttin&rsquo; in a word for yourself now, Pether?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure I am, an&rsquo; for both of us. I&rsquo;d surely be proud to see yourself
      an&rsquo; myself sittin&rsquo; in our glory upon our own jauntin&rsquo;-car. Sure we can
      afford it, an&rsquo; ought to have it, too. Bud-an&rsquo;-ager! what&rsquo;s the rason I
      didn&rsquo;t, think of it long ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe you did, acushla; but you forgot, it. Wasn&rsquo;t that the way wid you,
      Pether? Tell the thruth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, thin, bad luck to the lie in it, since you must know. About this
      time twelve months&mdash;no, faix, I&rsquo;m wrong, it was afore Dan&rsquo;s marriage&mdash;I
      had thoughts o&rsquo; spakin&rsquo; ta you about it, but somehow it left my head. Upon
      my word, I&rsquo;m in airnest, Ellish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, avick, make your mind asy; I&rsquo;ll have one from Dublin in less nor a
      fortnight. I can thin go about of an odd time, an&rsquo; see how Dan an&rsquo; 
      Pether&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; an. It&rsquo;ll be a pleasure to me to advise an&rsquo; direct them,
      sure, as far an&rsquo; as well as I can. I only hope? God will enable thim to do
      as much for their childher, as he enabled us to do for them, glory be to
      his name!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter&rsquo;s eye rested upon her as she spoke&mdash;a slight shade passed over
      his face, but it was the symptom of deep feeling and affection, whose
      current had run smooth and unbroken during the whole life they had spent
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ellish,&rdquo; said he, in a tone of voice that strongly expressed what he
      felt, &ldquo;you wor one o&rsquo; the best wives that ever the Almighty gev to mortual
      man. You wor, avourneen&mdash;-you wor, you wor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I intind, too, to begin an&rsquo; make my sowl, a little,&rdquo; she continued; &ldquo;we
      had so much to do, Pether, aroon, that, indeed, we hadn&rsquo;t time to think of
      it all along; but now, that everything else is settled, we ought to think
      about that, an&rsquo; make the most of our time&mdash;while we can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my conscience, I&rsquo;ve strong notions myself o&rsquo; the same thing,&rdquo;
       replied Peter. &ldquo;An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll back you in that, as well as in every thing else.
      Never fear, if we pull together, but we&rsquo;ll bring up the lost time. Faith,
      we will! Sowl, if you set about it, let me see them that &lsquo;ud prevint you
      goin&rsquo; to heaven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Paddy Donovan get the bay filly&rsquo;s foot aised, Pether?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone down wid her to the forge: the poor crathur was very lame
      to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right; an&rsquo; let Andy Murtagh bring down the sacks from Drumdough
      early to-morrow. That what ought to go to the market on Thursday, an&rsquo; the
      other stacks ought to be thrashed out of hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well; so it will be all done. Tare alive! if myself knows how
      you&rsquo;re able to keep an eye on everything. Come in, an&rsquo; let us have our
      tay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a few months after this, Ellish was perfectly in her element. The
      jaunting-car was procured; and her spirits seemed to be quite elevated.
      She paid regular visits to both her sons, looked closely into their manner
      of conducting business, examined their premises, and subjected every
      fixture and improvement made or introduced without her sanction, to the
      most rigorous scrutiny. In fact, what, between Peter&rsquo;s farm, her
      daughter&rsquo;s shop, and the establishments of her sons, she never found
      herself more completely encumbered with business. She had intended &ldquo;to
      make her soul,&rdquo; but her time was so fully absorbed by the affairs of those
      in whom she felt so strong an interest, that she really forgot the
      spiritual resolution in the warmth of her secular pursuits.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, about this time, a horse belonging to Peter happened to fall
      into a ditch, from which he was extricated with much difficulty by the
      laborers. Ellish, who thought it necessary to attend, had been standing
      for some time directing them how to proceed; her dress was rather thin,
      and the hour, which was about twilight, chilly, for it was the middle of
      autumn. Upon returning home she found herself cold, and inclined to
      shiver. At first she thought but little of these symptoms; for having
      never had a single day&rsquo;s sickness, she was scarcely competent to know that
      they were frequently the forerunners of very dangerous and fatal maladies.
      She complained, however, of slight illness, and went to bed without taking
      anything calculated to check what she felt. Her sufferings during the
      night were dreadful: high fever had set in with a fury that threatened to
      sweep the powers of life like a wreck before it. The next morning the
      family, on looking into her state more closely, found it necessary to send
      instantly for a physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving, he pronounced her to be in a dangerous pleurisy, from which,
      in consequence of her plethoric habit, he expressed but faint hopes of her
      recovery. This was melancholy intelligence to her sons and daughters: but
      to Peter, whose faithful wife she had been for thirty years, it was a
      dreadful communication indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No hopes, Docthor!&rdquo; he exclaimed, with a bewildered air: &ldquo;did you say no
      hopes, sir?&mdash;Oh! no, you didn&rsquo;t&mdash;you couldn&rsquo;t say that there&rsquo;s
      no hopes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hopes of her recovery, Mr. Connell, are but slender,&mdash;if any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Docthor, I&rsquo;m a rich man, thanks be to God an&rsquo; to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he
      hesitated, cast back a rapid and troubled look towards the bed whereon she
      lay, then proceeded&mdash;&ldquo;no matther, I&rsquo;m a rich man: but if you can
      spare her to me, I&rsquo;ll divide what I&rsquo;m worth in the world wid you: I will,
      sir; an&rsquo; if that won&rsquo;t do, I&rsquo;ll give up my last shillin&rsquo; to save her, an&rsquo; 
      thin I&rsquo;d beg my bit an&rsquo; sup through the counthry, only let me have her wid
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as my skill goes,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;I shall, of course, exert it
      to save her; but there are some diseases which we are almost always able
      to pronounce fatal at first sight. This, I fear, is one of them. Still I
      do not bid you despair&mdash;there is, I trust, a shadow of hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The blessin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the Almighty be upon you, sir, for that word! The best
      blessing of the heavenly Father rest upon you an&rsquo; yours for it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall return in the course of the day,&rdquo; continued the physician; &ldquo;and
      as you feel the dread of her loss so powerfully, I will bring two other
      medical gentlemen of skill with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens reward you for that, sir! The heavens above reward you an&rsquo; them
      for it! Payment!&mdash;och, that signifies but little: but you and them
      &lsquo;ll be well paid. Oh, Docthor, achora, thry an&rsquo; save her!&mdash;Och, thry
      an&rsquo; save her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep her easy,&rdquo; replied the doctor, &ldquo;and let my directions be faithfully
      followed. In the meantime, Mr. Connell, be a man and display proper
      fortitude under a dispensation which is common to all men in your state.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To talk of resignation to Peter was an abuse of words. The poor man had no
      more perception of the consolation arising from a knowledge of religion
      than a child. His heart sank within him, for the prop on which his
      affections had rested was suddenly struck down from under them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Ellish was in a dreadful state. Her malady seized her in the very
      midst of her worldly-mindedness; and the current of her usual thoughts,
      when stopped by the aberrations of intellect peculiar to her illness,
      bubbled up, during the temporary returns of reason, with a stronger relish
      of the world. It was utterly impossible for a woman like her, whose habits
      of thought and the tendency of whose affections had been all directed
      towards the acquisition of wealth, to wrench them for ever and at once
      from the objects on which they were fixed. This, at any time, would have
      been to her a difficult victory to achieve; but now, when stunned by the
      stroke of disease, and confused by the pangs of severe suffering, tortured
      by a feverish pulse and a burning brain, to expect that she could
      experience the calm hopes of religion, or feel the soothing power of
      Christian sorrow, was utter folly. &lsquo;Tis true, her life had been a harmless
      one: her example, as an industrious and enterprising member of society,
      was worthy of imitation. She was an excellent mother, a good neighbor, and
      an admirable wife; but the duties arising out of these different relations
      of life, were all made subservient to, and mixed up with, her great
      principle of advancing herself in the world, whilst that which is to come
      never engaged one moment&rsquo;s serious consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Father Mulcahy came to administer the rites of the church to Ellish,
      he found her in a state of incoherency. Occasional gleams of reason broke
      out through the cloud that obscured her intellect, but they carried with
      them the marks of a mind knit indissolubly to wealth and aggrandizement.
      The same tenor of thought, and the same broken fragments of ambitious
      speculation, floated in rapid confusion through the tempests of delirium
      which swept with awful darkness over her spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Connell,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;can you collect yourself? Strive to compose your
      mind, so far as to be able to receive the aids of religion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, oh!&mdash;my blood&rsquo;s boilin&rsquo;! Is that&mdash;is that Father Mulcahy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, dear: strive now to keep your mind calm, till you prepare yourself
      for judgment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep up his head, Paddy&mdash;keep up his head, or he&rsquo;ll be smothered
      undher the wather an&rsquo; the sludge. Here, Mike, take this rope: pull, man,&mdash;pull,
      or the horse will be lost! Oh, my head!&mdash;I&rsquo;m boilin&rsquo;&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      burnin&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Connell, let me entreat you to remember that you are on the point of
      death, and should raise your heart to God, for the pardon and remission of
      your sins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Father dear, I neglected that, but I intinded&mdash;I intinded&mdash;Where&rsquo;s
      Pether!&mdash;bring, bring&mdash;Pether to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn your thoughts to God, now, my dear. Are you clear enough in your
      mind for confession?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, Father! I am, avourneen. Come, come here, Pether! Pether, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; 
      to lave you, asthore machree! I could part wid them all but&mdash;but
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Connell, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this&mdash;is this&mdash;Father Mulcahy? Oh! I&rsquo;m ill&mdash;ill!&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, dear; it is. Compose yourself and confess your sins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mary? She&rsquo;ll neglect&mdash;neglect to lay in a stock o&rsquo; linen,
      although I&mdash;I&mdash;Oh, Father, avourneen! won&rsquo;t you pity me! I&rsquo;m
      sick&mdash;oh, I&rsquo;m very sick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are, dear&mdash;you are, God help you, very sick, but you&rsquo;ll be
      better soon. Could you confess, dear?&mdash;do you think you could?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, this pain&mdash;this pain!&mdash;it&rsquo;s killin&rsquo; me!&mdash;Pether&mdash;Pether,
      <i>a suillish, machree</i>, (* The light of my heart) have, have you des&mdash;have
      you desarted me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest, conjecturing that if Peter made his appearance she might feel
      soothed, and perhaps sufficiently composed to confess, called him in from
      the next room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Peter,&rdquo; said the priest, presenting him to her view&mdash;&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
      Peter, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! what a load is on me! this pain&mdash;this pain is killin&rsquo; me&mdash;won&rsquo;t
      you bring me, Pether? Oh, what will I do? Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mental pangs of poor Peter were, perhaps, equal in intensity to those
      which she suffered physically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ellish,&rdquo; said he, in smothered sobs&mdash;&ldquo;Ellish, acushla machree, sure
      I&rsquo;m wid you here; here I&rsquo;m sittin&rsquo; on the bed wid you, achora machree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Catch my hand, thin. Ah, Pether! won&rsquo;t you pity your Ellish?&mdash;Won&rsquo;t
      you pity me&mdash;won&rsquo;t you pity me? Oh! this pain&mdash;this pain&mdash;is
      killin&rsquo; me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, it is, my heart&rsquo;s delight&mdash;it&rsquo;s killin&rsquo; us both. Oh, Ellish,
      Ellish! I wish I was dead sooner nor see you in this agony. I ever loved
      you!&mdash;I ever an&rsquo; always loved you, avourneen dheelish; but now I
      would give my heart&rsquo;s best blood, if it&rsquo;ud save you. Here&rsquo;s Father Mulcahy
      come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the mon&mdash;about the money&mdash;Pether&mdash;what do you intind&mdash;&mdash;Oh!
      my blood&mdash;my blood&rsquo;s a-fire!&mdash;Mother o&rsquo;Heaven!&mdash;Oh! this
      pain is&mdash;is takin&rsquo; me from all&mdash;faix!&mdash;Rise me up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, my darlin&rsquo;&mdash;treasure o&rsquo; my heart here&mdash;I&rsquo;m puttin&rsquo; your
      head upon my breast&mdash;upon my breast, Ellish, ahagur. Marciful Virgin&mdash;Father
      dear,&rdquo; said Peter, bursting into bitter tears&mdash;&ldquo;her head&rsquo;s like fire!
      O! Ellish, Ellish, Ellish!&mdash;but my heart&rsquo;s brakin&rsquo; to feel this! Have
      marcy on her, sweet God&mdash;have marcy on her! Bear witness, Father of
      heaven&mdash;bear witness, an&rsquo; hear the vow of a brakin&rsquo; heart. I here
      solemnly promise before God, to make, if I&rsquo;m spared life an&rsquo; health to do
      it, a Station on my bare feet to Lough Derg, if it plases you, sweet
      Father o&rsquo; pity, to spare her to me this day! Oh! but the hand o&rsquo; God,
      Father dear, is terrible!&mdash;feel her brow!&mdash;Oh! but it&rsquo;s
      terrible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is terrible,&rdquo; said the priest; &ldquo;and terribly is it laid upon her, poor
      woman! Peter, do not let this scene be lost. Remember it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Father dear, can I ever forget it?&mdash;can I ever forget seein&rsquo; my
      darlin&rsquo; in sich agony?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pether,&rdquo; said the sick woman, &ldquo;will you get the car ready for to-mor&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;till
      I look at that piece o&rsquo; land that Dan bought, before he&mdash;he closes
      the bargain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, jewel!&rdquo; said Pether, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you get the world banished out of her
      heart? Oh, I&rsquo;d give all I&rsquo;m worth to see that heart fixed upon God! I
      could bear to part wid her, for she must die some time; but to go wid this
      world&rsquo;s thoughts an&rsquo; timptations ragin&rsquo; strong in her heart&mdash;mockin&rsquo; 
      God, an&rsquo; hope, an&rsquo; religion, an&rsquo; everything:&mdash;oh!&mdash;that I can&rsquo;t
      bear! Sweet Jasus, change her heart!&mdash;Queen o&rsquo; Heaven, have pity on
      her, an&rsquo; save her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The husband wept with great sorrow as he uttered these words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither reasoning nor admonition can avail her,&rdquo; replied the priest; &ldquo;she
      is so incoherent that no train of thought is continued for a single minute
      in her mind. I will, however, address her again. Mrs. Connell, will you
      make a straggle to pay attention to me for a few minutes? Are you not
      afraid to meet God? You are about to die!&mdash;prepare yourself for
      judgment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Father dear! I can&rsquo;t&mdash;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;I am af&mdash;afraid&mdash;Hooh!&mdash;hooh!&mdash;God!
      You must do some thin&rsquo;for&mdash;for me! I never done anything for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glory be to God! that she has that much sinse, any way,&rdquo; exclaimed her
      husband. &ldquo;Father, ahagur, I trust my vow was heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear&mdash;listen to me,&rdquo; continued the priest&mdash;&ldquo;can you
      not make the best confession possible? Could you calm yourself for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pether, avick machree&mdash;Pether,&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ellish, avourneen, I&rsquo;m here!&mdash;my darlin&rsquo;, I am your vick machree,
      an&rsquo; ever was. Oh, Father! my heart&rsquo;s brakin&rsquo;! I can&rsquo;t bear to part wid
      her. Father of heaven, pity us this day of throuble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be near me, Pether; stay wid me&mdash;I&rsquo;m very lonely. Is this you
      keepin&rsquo; my head up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, it is! I&rsquo;ll never lave you till&mdash;till&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the carman come from Dublin wid&mdash;wid the broadcloth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father of heaven! she&rsquo;s gone back again!&rdquo; exclaimed the husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, jewel! have you no prayers that you&rsquo;d read for her? You wor
      ordained for these things, an&rsquo; comin&rsquo; from you, they&rsquo;ll have more
      stringth. Can you do nothin&rsquo; to save my darlin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My prayers will not be wanting,&rdquo; said the priest: &ldquo;but I am watching for
      an interval of sufficient calmness to hear her confession; and I very much
      fear that she will pass in darkness. At all events, I will anoint her by
      and by. In the meantime, we must persevere a little longer; she may become
      easier, for it often happens that reason gets clear immediately before
      death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter sobbed aloud, and wiped away the tears that streamed from his
      cheeks. At this moment her daughter and son-in-law stole in, to ascertain
      how she was, and whether the rites of the church had in any degree soothed
      or composed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, Denis,&rdquo; said the priest to his nephew, &ldquo;you may both come in.
      Mrs. Mulcahy, speak to your mother: let us try every remedy that might
      possibly bring her to a sense of her awful state.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she raving still?&rdquo; inquired the daughter, whose eyes were red with
      weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest shook his head; &ldquo;Ah, she is&mdash;she is! and I fear she will
      scarcely recover her reason before the judgment of heaven opens upon her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh thin may the Mother of Glory forbid that!&rdquo; exclaimed her daughter&mdash;&ldquo;anything
      at all but that! Can you do nothin&rsquo; for her, uncle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing all I can for her, Mary,&rdquo; replied the priest; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m watching a
      calm moment to get her confession, if possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sick woman had fallen into a momentary silence, during which, she
      caught the bed-clothes like a child, and felt them, and seemed to handle
      their texture, but with such an air of vacancy as clearly manifested that
      no corresponding association existed in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The action was immediately understood by all present. Her daughter again
      burst into tears; and Peter, now almost choked with grief, pressing the
      sick woman to his heart, kissed her burning lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, jewel,&rdquo; said the daughter, &ldquo;there it is, and I feard it&mdash;the
      sign, uncle&mdash;the sign!&mdash;don&rsquo;t you see her gropin&rsquo; the clothes?
      Oh, mother, darlin&rsquo;, darlin&rsquo;!&mdash;are we going to lose you for ever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Ellish, Ellish&mdash;won&rsquo;t you spake one word to me afore you go?
      Won&rsquo;t you take one farewell of me&mdash;of me, aroon asthore, before you
      depart from us for ever!&rdquo; exclaimed her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feeling the bed-clothes,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;is not always a, sign of
      death; I have known many to recover after it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Husht,&rdquo; said Peter&mdash;&ldquo;husht!&mdash;Mary&mdash;Mary! Come hear&mdash;hould
      your tongues! Oh, it&rsquo;s past&mdash;it&rsquo;s past!&mdash;it&rsquo;s all past, an&rsquo; gone&mdash;all
      hope&rsquo;s over! Heavenly fither!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The daughter, after listening for a moment, in a paroxysm of wild grief,
      clasped her mother&rsquo;s recumbent body in her arms, and kissed hen lips with
      a vehemence almost frantic. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t go, my darlin&rsquo;&mdash;is it from
      your own Mary that you&rsquo;d go? Mary, that you loved best of all your
      childhre!&mdash;Mary that you always said, an&rsquo; every body said, was your
      own image! Oh, you won&rsquo;t go without one word, to say you know her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; said Father Mulcahy, &ldquo;what do you mean?&mdash;are you
      mad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! uncle dear! don&rsquo;t you hear?&mdash;don&rsquo;t you hear?&mdash;listen an&rsquo; 
      sure you will&mdash;all hope&rsquo;s gone now&mdash;gone&mdash;gone! The dead
      rattle!&mdash;listen!&mdash;the dead rattle&rsquo;s in her throat!&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest bent his ear a moment, and distinctly heard the gurgling noise
      produced by the phlegm, which is termed with wild poetical accuracy, by
      the peasantry&mdash;the &ldquo;dead rattle,&rdquo; or &ldquo;death rattle,&rdquo; because it is
      the immediate and certain forerunner of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the priest&mdash;&ldquo;too true; the last shadow of hope is gone.
      We must now make as much of the time as possible. Leave the room for a few
      minutes till I anoint her, I will then call you in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They accordingly withdrew, but in about fifteen or twenty minutes he once
      more summoned them to the bed of the dying woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have anointed her&mdash;come in, and kneel down
      till we offer up a Rosary to the Blessed Virgin, under the hope that she
      may intercede with God for her, and cause her to pass out of life happily.
      She was calling for you, Peter, in your absence; you had better stay with
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Peter, in a broken voice; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay nowhere else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo;I&rsquo;ll kneel at the bed-side,&rdquo; said the daughter. &ldquo;She was the kind
      mother to me, and to us all; but to me in particular. &lsquo;Twas with me she
      took her choice to live, when they war all striving for her. Oh,&rdquo; said
      she, taking her mother&rsquo;s hand between hers, and kneeling-down to kiss it,
      &ldquo;a Vahr dheelish! (* sweet mother) did we ever think to see you departing
      from us this way! snapped away without a minute&rsquo;s warning! If it was a
      long-sickness, that you&rsquo;d be calm and sinsible in, but to be hurried away
      into eternity, and your mind dark! Oh, Vhar dheelish, my heart is broke to
      see you this way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be calm,&rdquo; said the priest; &ldquo;be quiet till I open the Rosary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then offered up the usual prayers which precede its repetition, and
      after having concluded them, commenced what is properly called the Rosary
      itself, which consists of fifteen Decades, each Decade containing the Hail
      Mary repeated ten times, and the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer once. In this manner the
      Decade goes round from one to another, until, as we have said above, it is
      repeated fifteen times; or, in all, the Ave Maria&rsquo;s one hundred and
      sixty-five times, without variation. From the indistinct utterance,
      elevated voice, and rapid manner in which it is pronounced, it certainly
      has a wild effect, and is more strongly impressed with the character of a
      mystic rite, or incantation, than with any other religious ceremony with
      which we could compare it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the priest had repeated the first part, he paused for the response:
      neither the husband nor daughter, however, could find utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Denis,&rdquo; said he, to his nephew, &ldquo;do you take up the next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His nephew complied; and with much difficulty Peter and his daughter were
      able to join in it, repeating here and there a word or two, as well as
      their grief and sobbings would permit them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heart must indeed have been an unfeeling one, to which a scene like
      this would not have been deeply touching and impressive. The poor dying
      woman reclined with her head upon her husband&rsquo;s bosom; the daughter knelt
      at the bed-side, with her mother&rsquo;s hand pressed against her lips, she
      herself convulsed with sorrow&mdash;the priest was in the attitude of
      earnest supplication, having the stole about his neck, his face and arms
      raised towards heaven&mdash;the son-in-law was bent over a chair, with his
      face buried in his hands. Nothing could exceed the deep, the powerful
      expression of entreaty, which marked every tone and motion of the parties,
      especially those of the husband and daughter. They poured an energy into
      the few words which they found voice to utter, and displayed such a
      concentration of the faculties of the soul in their wild unregulated
      attitudes, and streaming, upturned eyes, as would seem to imply that their
      own salvation depended upon that of the beloved object before them. Their
      words, too, were accompanied by such expressive tokens of their attachment
      to her, that the character of prayer was heightened by the force of the
      affection which they bore her. When Peter, for instance, could command
      himself to utter a word, he pressed his dying wife to his bosom, and
      raised his eyes to heaven in a manner that would have melted any human
      heart; and the daughter, on joining occasionally in the response, pressed
      her mother&rsquo;s hand to her heart, and kissed it with her lips, conscious
      that the awful state of her parent had rendered more necessary the
      performance of the two tenderest duties connected with a child&rsquo;s obedience&mdash;prayer
      and affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the son-in-law had finished his Decade, a pause followed, for there
      was none now to proceed but her husband, or her daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary, dear,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;be a woman; don&rsquo;t let your love for your
      mother prevent you from performing a higher duty. Go on with the prayer&mdash;you
      see she is passing fast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try, uncle,&rdquo; she replied&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try; but&mdash;but&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      hard, hard, upon me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She commenced, and by an uncommon effort so far subdued her grief, as to
      render her words intelligible. Her eyes, streaming with tears, were fixed
      with a mixture of wildness, sorrow, and devotedness, upon the countenance
      of her mother, until she had completed her Decade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another pause ensued. It was now necessary, according to the order and
      form of the Prayer, that Peter should commence and offer up his
      supplications for the happy passage from life to eternity of her who had
      been his inward idol during a long period. Peter knew nothing about
      sentiment, or the philosophy of sorrow; but he loved his wife with the
      undivided power of a heart in which nature had implanted her strongest
      affections. He knew, too, that his wife had loved him with a strength of
      heart equal to his own. He loved her, and she deserved his love.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pause, when the prayer had gone round to him, was long; those who were
      present at length turned their eyes towards him, and the priest, now
      deeply affected, cleared his voice, and simply said, &ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; to remind
      him that it was his duty to proceed with the Rosary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter, however, instead of uttering the prayer, burst out into a tide of
      irrepressible sorrow.&mdash;&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said he, enfolding her in his arms, and
      pressing his lips to hers: &ldquo;Ellish, ahagur machree! sure when I think of
      all the goodness, an&rsquo; kindness, an&rsquo; tendherness that you showed me&mdash;whin
      I think of your smiles upon me, whin you wanted me to do the right, an&rsquo; 
      the innocent plans you made out, to benefit me an&rsquo; mine!&mdash;Oh! where
      was your harsh word, avillish?&mdash;where was your could brow, or your
      bad tongue? Nothin&rsquo; but goodness&mdash;nothin&rsquo; but kindness, an&rsquo; love, an&rsquo; 
      wisdom, ever flowed from these lips! An&rsquo; now, darlin&rsquo;, pulse o&rsquo; my broken
      heart! these same lips can&rsquo;t spake to me&mdash;these eyes don&rsquo;t know me&mdash;these
      hands don&rsquo;t feel me&mdash;nor your ears doesn&rsquo;t hear me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is&mdash;is&mdash;it you?&rdquo; replied his wife feebly&mdash;&ldquo;is it&mdash;you?&mdash;come&mdash;come
      near me&mdash;my heart&mdash;my heart says it misses you&mdash;come near
      me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter again pressed her in an embrace, and, in doing so, unconsciously
      received the parting breath of a wife whose prudence and affection had
      saved him from poverty, and, probably, from folly or crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest, on turning round to rebuke Peter for not proceeding with the
      prayer, was the first who discovered that she had died; for the grief of
      her husband was too violent to permit him to notice anything with much
      accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I beg your pardon; let me take the trouble of
      supporting her for a few minutes, after which I must talk to you seriously&mdash;very
      seriously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The firm, authoritative tone in which the priest spoke, together with
      Peter&rsquo;s consciousness that he had acted wrongly by neglecting to join in
      the Rosary, induced him to retire from the bed with a rebuked air. The
      priest immediately laid back the head&rsquo; of Mrs. Connell on the pillow, and
      composed the features of her lifeless face with his own hands. Until this
      moment none of them, except himself, knew that she was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;all her cares, and hopes, and speculations, touching
      this world, are over&mdash;so is her pain; her blood will soon be cold
      enough, and her head will ache no more. She is dead. Grief is therefore
      natural; but let it be the grief of a man, Peter. Indeed, it is less
      painful to look upon her now, than when she suffered such excessive agony.
      Mrs. Mulcahy, hear me! Oh, it&rsquo;s in vain! Well, well, it is but natural;
      for it was an unexpected and a painful death!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cries of her husband and daughter soon gave intimation to her servants
      that her pangs were over. From the servants it immediately went to the
      neighbors, and thus did the circle widen until it reached the furthest
      ends of the parish. In a short time, also, the mournful sounds of the
      church-bell, in slow and measured strokes, gave additional notice that a
      Christian soul had passed into eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is in such scenes as these that the Roman Catholic clergy knit
      themselves so strongly into the affections of the people. All men are
      naturally disposed to feel the offices of kindness and friendship more
      deeply, when tendered at the bed of death or of sickness, than under any
      other circumstances. Both the sick-bed and the house of death are
      necessarily the sphere of a priest&rsquo;s duty, and to render them that justice
      which we will ever render, when and wheresoever it may be due, we freely
      grant that many shining, nay, noble instances of Christian virtue are
      displayed by them on such occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the violence of grief produced by Ellish&rsquo;s death had subsided, the
      priest, after giving them suitable exhortations to bear the affliction
      which had just befallen them with patience, told Peter, that as God,
      through the great industry and persevering exertions of her who had then
      departed to another world, had blessed him abundantly with wealth and
      substance, it was, considering the little time which had been allowed her
      to repent in a satisfactory manner for her transgressions, his bounden and
      solemn duty to set aside a suitable portion of that wealth for the
      delivery of her soul from purgatory, where, he trusted, in the mercy of
      God, it was permitted to remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, your Reverence,&rdquo; replied Peter, &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t necessary to mintion
      it, considherin&rsquo; the way she was cut off from among us, widout even time
      to confess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But blessed be God,&rdquo; said the daughter, &ldquo;she received the ointment at any
      rate, and that of itself would get her to purgatory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I can answer for her,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;that she intended, as soon as
      she&rsquo;d get everything properly settled for the childhre, to make her sowl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! good intentions,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t do. I, however, have
      forewarned you of your duty, and must now leave the guilt or the merit of
      relieving her departed spirit, upon you and the other members of her
      family, who are all bound to leave nothing undone that may bring her from
      pain and fire, to peace and happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Och! och! asthore, asthore! you&rsquo;re lyin&rsquo; there&mdash;an&rsquo;, oh, Ellish,
      avourneen, could you think that I&mdash;I&mdash;would spare money&mdash;trash&mdash;to
      bring you to glory wid the angels o&rsquo; heaven! No, no, Father dear. It&rsquo;s
      good, an&rsquo; kind, an&rsquo; thoughtful of you to put it into my head; but I didn&rsquo;t
      intind to neglect or forget it. Oh, how will I live wantin&rsquo; her, Father?
      When I rise in the mornin&rsquo;, avillish, where &lsquo;ud be your smile and your
      voice? We won&rsquo;t hear your step, nor see you as we used to do, movin&rsquo; 
      pleasantly about the place. No&mdash;you&rsquo;re gone, avoumeen&mdash;gone&mdash;an&rsquo; 
      we&rsquo;ll see you and hear you no more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His grief was once more about to burst forth, but the priest led him out
      of the room, kindly chid him for the weakness of his immoderate sorrow,
      and after making arrangements about the celebration of mass for the dead,
      pressed his hand, and bade the family farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The death of Ellish excited considerable surprise, and much conversation
      in the neighborhood. Every point of her character was discussed freely,
      and the comparisons instituted between her and Peter were anything but
      flattering to the intellect of her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; so Ellish is whipped off, Larry,&rdquo; said a neighbor to one of Peter&rsquo;s
      laboring men, &ldquo;Faix, an&rsquo; the best feather in their wing is gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, sure enough, Risthard, you may say that. It was her cleverness made
      them what they are. She was the best manager in the three kingdoms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, she was the woman could make a bargain. I only hope she hasn&rsquo;t
      brought the luck o&rsquo; the family away wid her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, man alive, she made the sons and daughters as clever as herself&mdash;put
      them up to everything. Indeed, it&rsquo;s quare to think of how that one woman
      brought them ris them to what they are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They shouldn&rsquo;t forget themselves as they&rsquo;re doin&rsquo;, thin; for betune you
      an&rsquo; me, they&rsquo;re as proud as Turks, an&rsquo; God he sees it ill becomes them&mdash;sits
      very badly on them, itself, when everything knows that their father an&rsquo; 
      mother begun the world wid a bottle of private whiskey an&rsquo; half a pound of
      smuggled tobaccy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Pether will break his heart, any way. Oh, man, but she was the good
      wife. I&rsquo;m livin&rsquo; wid them going an seven year, an&rsquo; never hard a cross word
      from the one to the other. It&rsquo;s she that had the sweet tongue all out, an&rsquo; 
      did manage him; but, afther all, he was worth the full o&rsquo; the Royal George
      of her. Many a time, when some poor craythur &lsquo;ud come to ax whiskey on
      score to put over* some o&rsquo; their friends, or for a weddin&rsquo;, or a
      christenin&rsquo;, maybe, an&rsquo; when the wife &lsquo;ud refuse it, Pether &lsquo;ud send what
      whiskey they wanted afther them, widout lettin&rsquo; her know anything about
      it. An&rsquo;, indeed, he never lost anything by that; for if they wor to sell
      their cow, he should be ped, in regard of the kindly way he gave it to
      them.&rdquo;

      Such was the view which had been taken of their respective characters
      through life. Yet, notwithstanding that the hearts of their acquaintances
      never warmed to her&mdash;to use a significant expression current among
      the peasantry&mdash;as they did to Peter, still she was respected almost
      involuntarily for the indefatigable perseverance with which she pushed
      forward her own interests through life. Her funeral was accordingly a
      large one; and the conversation which took place at it, turning, as it
      necessarily did, upon her extraordinary talents and industry, was highly
      to the credit of her memory and virtues. Indeed, the attendance of many
      respectable persons of all creeds and opinions, gave ample proof that the
      qualities she possessed had secured for her general respect and
      admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Peter, who was an object of great compassion, felt himself completely
      crushed by the death of his faithful partner. The reader knows that he had
      hitherto been a sober, and, owing to Ellish&rsquo;s prudent control, an
      industrious man. To thought or reflection he was not, however, accustomed;
      he had, besides, never received any education; if his morals were correct,
      it was because a life of active employment had kept him engaged in
      pursuits which repressed immorality, and separated him from those whose
      society and influence might have been prejudicial to him. He had scarcely
      known calamity, and when it occurred he was prepared for it neither by
      experience nor a correct view of moral duty. On the morning of his wife&rsquo;s
      funeral, such was his utter prostration both of mind and body, that even
      his own sons, in order to resist the singular state of collapse into which
      he had sunk, urged him to take some spirits. He was completely passive in
      their hands, and complied. This had the desired effect, and he found
      himself able to attend the funeral. When the friends of Ellish assembled,
      after the interment, as is usual, to drink and talk together, Peter, who
      could scarcely join in the conversation, swallowed glass after glass of
      punch with great rapidity. In the mean time, the talk became louder and
      more animated; the punch, of course, began to work, and as they sat long,
      it was curious to observe the singular blending of mirth and sorrow,
      singing and weeping, laughter and tears, which characterized this
      remarkable scene. Peter, after about two hours&rsquo; hard drinking, was not an
      exception to the influence of this trait of national manners. His heart
      having been deeply agitated, was the more easily brought under the effects
      of contending emotions. He was naturally mirthful, and when intoxication
      had stimulated the current of his wonted humor, the influence of this and
      his recent sorrow produced such an anomalous commixture of fun and grief
      as could seldom, out of Ireland, be found checkering the mind of one
      individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the midst of this extraordinary din that his voice was heard
      commanding silence in its loudest and best-humored key:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hould yer tongues,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;bad win to yees, don&rsquo;t you hear me wantin&rsquo; 
      to sing! Whist wid yees. Hem&mdash;och&mdash;&lsquo;Eise up&rsquo;&mdash;Why, thin,
      Phil Callaghan, you might thrate me wid more dacency, if you had gumption
      in you; I&rsquo;m sure no one has a betther right to sing first in this company
      nor myself; an&rsquo; what&rsquo;s more, I will sing first. Hould your tongues! Hem!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He accordingly commenced a popular song, the air of which, though simple,
      was touchingly mournful.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Och, rise up, Willy Reilly, an&rsquo; come wid me,
     I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; for to go wid you, and lave this counteree;
     I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to lave my father, his castles and freelands&mdash;
     An&rsquo; away what Willy Reilly, an&rsquo; his own Colleen Bawn.

     &ldquo;Och, they wint o&rsquo;er hills an&rsquo; mountains, and valleys that was
          fair,
     An&rsquo; fled before her father as you may shortly hear;
     Her father followed afther wid a well-chosen armed band,
     Och, an&rsquo; taken was poor Reilly, an&rsquo; his own Colleen Bawn.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The simple pathos of the tune, the affection implied by the words, and
      probably the misfortune of Willy Reilly, all overcame him, He finished the
      second verse with difficulty, and on attempting to commence a third he
      burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colleen bawn! (fair, or fair-haired girl)&mdash;Colleen bawn!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s lyin&rsquo; low that was my colleen bawn! Oh, will ye hould
      your tongues, an&rsquo; let me think of what has happened me? She&rsquo;s gone: Mary,
      avourneen, isn&rsquo;t she gone from us? I&rsquo;m alone, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll be always lonely.
      Who have I now to comfort me? I know I have good childhre, neighbors; but
      none o&rsquo; them, all of them, if they wor ten times as many, isn&rsquo;t aqual to
      her that&rsquo;s in the grave. Her hands won&rsquo;t be about me&mdash;there was
      tindherness in their very touch. An&rsquo;, of a Sunday mornin&rsquo;, how she&rsquo;d tie
      an my handkerchy, for I never could rightly tie it an myself, the knot was
      ever an&rsquo; always too many for me; but, och, och, she&rsquo;d tie it an so snug
      an&rsquo; purty wid her own hands, that I didn&rsquo;t look the same man! The same
      song was her favorite, Here&rsquo;s your healths; an&rsquo; sure it&rsquo;s the first time
      ever we wor together that she wasn&rsquo;t wid us: but now, avillish, your voice
      is gone&mdash;you&rsquo;re silent and lonely in the grave; an&rsquo; why shouldn&rsquo;t I
      be sarry for the wife o&rsquo; my heart that never angered me? Why shouldn&rsquo;t I?
      Ay, Mary, asthore, machree, good right you have to cry afther her; she was
      the kind mother to you; her heart was fixed in you; there&rsquo;s her fatures on
      your face; her very eyes, an&rsquo; fair hair, too, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll love you, achora,
      ten times more nor ever, for her sake. Another favorite song of hers, God
      rest her, was &lsquo;Brian O&rsquo;Lynn.&rsquo; Troth an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll sing it, so I will, for if
      she was livin&rsquo; she&rsquo;d like it.

      Oh, my head&rsquo;s through other! The sarra one o&rsquo; me I bleeve, but&rsquo;s out o&rsquo; 
      the words, or, as they say, there&rsquo;s a hole in the ballad. Send round the

      an inch of your life, if you don&rsquo;t Shrink. Send round the punch, Dan; an&rsquo;

      Father Soolaghan&rsquo;s horse, the day he gave his shirt to the sick man in the
      ditch. The Lord rest his sowl in glory&mdash;ha, ha, ha&mdash;I&rsquo;ll never
      forget it. Paddy, the song, you thief?&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Throth, an&rsquo; I will; but don&rsquo;t be Mitherin me. Faith, this is The height

      Och, och, are we parted at last? Upon my sowl, my heart&rsquo;s breakin&rsquo;&mdash;breakin&rsquo;,

      it is tip-top punch that&mdash;the poor man fell sick of a faver, an&rsquo; sure
      enough, when it was known what ailed him, the neighbors built a little
      shed on the roadside for him, in regard that every one was afeard to let
      him into their place. Howsomever&mdash;ha, ha, ha&mdash;Father Soolaghan
      was one day ridin&rsquo; past upon his horse, an&rsquo; seein&rsquo; the crathur lyin&rsquo; 
      undher the shed, on a whisp o&rsquo; straw, he pulls bridle, an&rsquo; puts the spake
      on the poor sthranger. So, begad, it came out, that the neighbors were
      very kind to him, an&rsquo; used to hand over whatsomever they thought best for
      him from the back o&rsquo; the ditch, as well as they could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My poor fellow,&rsquo; said the priest, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re badly off for linen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Thrue for you, sir,&rsquo; said the sick man, &lsquo;I never longed for anything so
      much in my life, as I do for a clane shirt an&rsquo; a glass o&rsquo; whiskey.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The devil a glass o&rsquo; whiskey I have about me, but you shall have the
      clane shirt, you poor compassionate crathur,&rsquo; said the priest, stretchin&rsquo; 
      his neck up an&rsquo; down to make sure there was no one comin&rsquo; on the road&mdash;ha,
      ha, ha!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well an&rsquo; good&mdash;&lsquo;I have three shirts,&rsquo; says his Reverence, &lsquo;but I
      have only one o&rsquo; them an me, an&rsquo; that you shall have.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So the priest peels himself on the spot, an&rsquo; lays his black coat and
      waistcoat afore him acrass the saddle, thin takin&rsquo; off his shirt, he threw
      it acrass the ditch to the sick man. Whether it was the white shirt, or
      the black coat danglin&rsquo; about the horse&rsquo;s neck, the divil a one o&rsquo; myself

      By the time he had arrived at this patch, he was able to engross no great
      portion either of the conversation or attention. Almost every one present
      had his songs, his sorrows, his laughter, or his anecdotes, as well as
      himself. Every voice was loud; and every tongue busy. Intricate and
      entangled was the talk, which, on the present occasion, presented a union
      of all the extremes which the lights and shadows of the Irish character
      alone could exhibit under such a calamity as that which brought the
      friends of the deceased together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter literally fulfilled his promise of taking a jorum in future. He was
      now his own master; and as he felt the loss of his wife deeply, he
      unhappily had recourse to the bottle, to bury the recollection of a woman,
      whose death left a chasm in his heart, which he thought nothing but the
      whiskey could fill up.
    </p>
    <p>
      His transition from a life of perfect sobriety to one of habitual, nay, of
      daily intoxication, was immediate. He could not bear to be sober; and his
      extraordinary bursts of affliction, even in his cups, were often
      calculated to draw tears from the eyes of those who witnessed them. He
      usually went out in the morning with a flask of whiskey in his pocket, and
      sat down to weep behind a ditch&mdash;where, however, after having emptied
      his flask, he might be heard at a great distance, singing the songs which
      Ellish in her life-time was accustomed to love. In fact, he was generally
      pitied; his simplicity of character, and his benevolence of heart, which
      was now exercised without fear of responsibility, made him more a favorite
      than he ever had been. His former habits of industry were thrown aside; as
      he said himself, he hadn&rsquo;t heart to work; his farms were neglected, and
      but for his son-in-law, would have gone to ruin. Peter himself was
      sensible of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take them,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;into your own hands, Denis; for me, I&rsquo;m not able to
      do anything more at them; she that kep me up is gone, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m broken down.
      Take them&mdash;take them into your own hands. Give me my bed, bit, an&rsquo; 
      sup, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s all I Want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Six months produced an incredible change in his appearance. Intemperance,
      whilst it shattered his strong frame, kept him in frequent exuberance of
      spirits; but the secret grief preyed on him within. Artificial excitement
      kills, but it never cures; and Peter, in the midst of his mirth and
      jollity, was wasting away into a shadow. His children, seeing him go down
      the hill of life so rapidly, consulted among each other on the best means
      of winning him back to sobriety. This was a difficult task, for his powers
      of bearing liquor were prodigious. He has often been known to drink so
      many as twenty-five, and sometimes thirty tumblers of punch, without being
      taken off his legs, or rendered incapable of walking about. His friends,
      on considering who was most likely to recall him to a more becoming life,
      resolved to apply to his landlord&mdash;the gentleman whom we have already
      introduced to our readers. He entered warmly into their plan, and it was
      settled, that Peter should be sent for, and induced, if possible, to take
      an oath against liquor. Early the following-day a liveried servant came
      down to inform him that his master wished to speak with him. &ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo;
       said Peter; &ldquo;divil resave the man in all Europe I&rsquo;d do more for than the
      same gintleman, if it was only on account of the regard he had for her
      that&rsquo;s gone. Come, I&rsquo;ll go wid you in a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He accordingly returned with the flask in his hand, saying, &ldquo;I never
      thravel widout a pocket-pistol, John. The times, you see, is not overly
      safe, an&rsquo; the best way is to be prepared!&mdash;ha, ha, ha! Och, och! It
      houlds three half-pints.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; observed the servant, &ldquo;you had better not taste that till after
      your return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come away, man,&rdquo; said Peter; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll talk upon it as we go along: I
      couldn&rsquo;t do readily widout it. You hard that I lost Ellish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the servant, &ldquo;and I was very sorry to hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you attind the berrin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but my master did,&rdquo; replied the man; &ldquo;for, indeed, his respect for
      your wife was very great, Mr. Connell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was before ten o&rsquo;clock in the forenoon, and about one in the
      afternoon a stout countryman was seen approaching the gentleman&rsquo;s house,
      with another man bent round his neck, where he hung precisely as a calf
      hangs round the shoulders of a butcher, when he is carrying it to his
      stall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; said the owner of the mansion to his lady, &ldquo;what has
      happened to John Smith, my dear? Is he dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; said his lady, going in much alarm to the drawing-room window: &ldquo;I
      protest I fear so, Frank. He is evidently dead! For God&rsquo;s sake go down and
      see what has befallen him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her husband went hastily to the hall-door, where he met Peter with his
      burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of Heaven, what has happened, Connell?&mdash;what is the
      matter with John? Is he living or dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, plase your honor, as I have him on my shouldhers, will you tell me
      where his bed is?&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;I may as well lave him snug, as my
      hand&rsquo;s in, poor fellow. The devil&rsquo;s bad head he has, your honor. Faith,
      it&rsquo;s a burnin&rsquo; shame, so it is, an&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; else&mdash;to be able to bear
      so little!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady, children, and servants, were now all assembled about the dead
      footman, who hung, in the mean time, very quietly round Peter&rsquo;s neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious Heaven! Connell, is the man dead?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, thin, he is, ma&rsquo;am,&mdash;for a while, any how; but, upon my
      credit, it&rsquo;s a burnin&rsquo; shame, so it is,&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man is drunk, my dear,&rdquo; said her husband&mdash;&ldquo;he&rsquo;s only drunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;a burnin&rsquo; shame, so it is&mdash;to be able to bear no more nor
      about six glasses, an&rsquo; the whiskey good, too. Will you ordher one o&rsquo; thim
      to show me his bed, ma&rsquo;am, if you plase,&rdquo; continued Peter, &ldquo;while he&rsquo;s an
      me? It&rsquo;ll save throuble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connell is right,&rdquo; observed his landlord. &ldquo;Gallagher, show him John&rsquo;s
      bed-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter accordingly followed another servant, who pointed out his bed, and
      assisted to place the vanquished footman in a somewhat easier position
      than that in which Peter had carried him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connell,&rdquo; said his landlord, when he returned, &ldquo;how did this happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, thin, it&rsquo;s a burnin&rsquo; shame,&rdquo; said Connell, &ldquo;to be able only to
      bear&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how did it happen? for he has been hitherto a perfectly sober man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix, plase your honor, asy enough,&rdquo; replied Peter; &ldquo;he began to lecthur
      me about! dhrinkin&rsquo; so, says I, &lsquo;Come an&rsquo; sit down behind the hedge here,
      an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll talk it over between us;&rsquo; so we went in, the two of us, a-back
      o&rsquo; the ditch&mdash;an&rsquo; he began to advise me agin dhrink, an&rsquo; I began to
      tell him about her that&rsquo;s gone, sir. Well, well! och, och! no matther!&mdash;So,
      sir, one story an&rsquo; one pull from the bottle, brought on another, for divil
      a glass we had at all, sir. Faix, he&rsquo;s a tindher-hearted boy, anyhow; for
      as myself I begun to let the tears down, whin the bottle was near out,
      divil resave the morsel of him but cried afther poor Ellish, as if she had
      been his mother. Faix, he did! An&rsquo; it won&rsquo;t be the last sup we&rsquo;ll have
      together, plase goodness! But the best of it was, sir, that the dhrunker
      he got, he abused me the more for dhrinkin&rsquo;. Oh, thin, but he&rsquo;s the pious
      boy whin he gets a sup in his head! Faix, it&rsquo;s a pity ever he&rsquo;d be sober,
      he talks so much scripthur an&rsquo; devotion in his liquor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connell,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;I am exceedingly sorry to hear that you
      have taken so openly and inveterately to drink as you have done, ever
      since the death of your admirable wife. This, in fact, was what occasioned
      me to send for you. Come into the parlor. Don&rsquo;t go, my dear; perhaps your
      influence may also be necessary. Gallagher, look to Smith, and see that
      every attention is paid him, until he recovers the effects of his
      intoxication.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then entered the parlor, where the following dialogue took place
      between him and Peter:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connell, I am really grieved to hear that you have become latterly so
      incorrigible a drinker; I sent for you to-day, with the hope of being able
      to induce you to give it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix, your honor, it&rsquo;s jist what I&rsquo;d expect from your father&rsquo;s son&mdash;kindness,
      an&rsquo; dacency, an&rsquo; devotion, wor always among yez. Divil resave the family
      in all Europe I&rsquo;d do so much for as the same family:&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman and lady looked at each other, and smiled. They knew that
      Peter&rsquo;s blarney was no omen of their success in the laudable design they
      contemplated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, Peter, for your good opinion; but in the meantime allow me
      to ask, what can you propose to yourself by drinking so incessantly as you
      do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I propose to myself by dhrinkin&rsquo;, is it? Why thin to banish
      grief, your honor. Surely you&rsquo;ll allow that no man has reason to complain
      who&rsquo;s able to banish the thief for two shillins a-day. I reckon the
      whiskey at first cost, so that it doesn&rsquo;t come to more nor that at the
      very outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is taking a commercial view of affliction, Connell; but you must
      promise me to give up drinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why thin upon my credit, your honor astonishes me. Is it to give up
      banishin&rsquo; grief? I have a regard for you, sir, for many a dalin we had
      together; but for all that, faix, I&rsquo;d be miserable for no man, barrin&rsquo; for
      her that&rsquo;s gone. If I&rsquo;d be so to oblage any one, I&rsquo;d do it for your
      family; for divil the family in all Europe &ldquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easy, Connell&mdash;I am not to be palmed off in that manner; I really
      have a respect for the character which you bore, and wish you to recover
      it once more. Consider that you are disgracing yourself and your children
      by drinking so excessively from day to day&mdash;indeed, I am told, almost
      from hour to hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Augh! don&rsquo;t believe the half o&rsquo; what you hear, sir. Faith, somebody has
      been dhraw-in&rsquo; your honor out! Why I&rsquo;m never dhrunk, sir; faith, I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will destroy your health, Connell, as well as your character;
      besides, you are not to be told that it is a sin, a crime against. God,
      and an evil example to society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show me the man, plase your honor, that ever seen me incapable. That&rsquo;s
      the proof o&rsquo; the thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why do you drink at all? It is not-necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; do you never taste a dhrop yourself, sir, plase your honor? I&rsquo;ll be
      bound you do, sir, raise your little finger of an odd time, as well as
      another. Eh, Ma&rsquo;am? That&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; close to his honor! An&rsquo; faix, small
      blame to him, an&rsquo; a weeshy sup o&rsquo; the wine to the misthress herself, to
      correct the tindherness of her dilicate appetite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter, this bantering must not pass: I think I have a claim upon your
      respect and deference. I have uniformly been your friend and the friend of
      your children and family, but more especially of your late excellent and
      exemplary wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before God an&rsquo; man I acknowledge that, sir&mdash;I do&mdash;I do. But,
      sir; to spake sarious&mdash;it&rsquo;s thruth, Ma&rsquo;am, downright&mdash;to spake
      sarious, my heart&rsquo;s broke, an&rsquo; every day it&rsquo;s brakin&rsquo; more an&rsquo; more. She&rsquo;s
      gone, sir, that used to manage me; an&rsquo; now I can&rsquo;t turn myself to
      anything, barrin&rsquo; the dhrink&mdash;God help me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I honor you, Connell, for the attachment which you bear towards the
      memory of your wife, but I utterly condemn the manner in which you display
      it. To become a drunkard is to disgrace her memory. You know it was a
      character she detested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it all, sir, an&rsquo; that you have thruth an rason on your side; but,
      sir, you never lost a wife that you loved; an&rsquo; long may you be so, I pray
      the heavenly Father this day! Maybe if you did, sir, plase your honor,
      that, wid your heart sinkin&rsquo; like a stone widin you, you&rsquo;d thry whether or
      not something couldn&rsquo;t rise it. Sir, only for the dhrink I&rsquo;d be dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There I totally differ from you, Connell. The drink only prolongs your
      grief, by adding to it the depression of spirits which it always produces.
      Had you not become a drinker, you would long before this have been once
      more a cheerful, active, and industrious man. Your sorrow would have worn
      away gradually, and nothing but an agreeable melancholy&mdash;an
      affectionate remembrance of your excellent wife&mdash;would have remained.
      Look at other men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where&rsquo;s the man, sir, had sich a wife to grieve for as she was? Don&rsquo;t
      be hard on me, sir. I&rsquo;m not a dhrunkard. It&rsquo;s thrue I dhrink a great dale;
      but thin I can bear a great dale, so that I&rsquo;m never incapable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connell,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;you will break down your constitution, and
      bring yourself to an earlier death than you would otherwise meet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I care very little, indeed, how soon I was dead, not makin&rsquo; you, Ma&rsquo;am,
      an ill answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh fie, Connell, for you, a sensible man and a Christian, to talk in such
      a manner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throth, thin, I don&rsquo;t, Ma&rsquo;am. She&rsquo;s gone, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d be glad to folly her as
      soon as I could. Yes, asthore, you&rsquo;re departed from me! an&rsquo; now I&rsquo;m gone
      asthray&mdash;out o&rsquo; the right an&rsquo; out o&rsquo; the good! Oh, Ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he
      proceeded, whilst the tears rolled fast down his cheeks, &ldquo;if you knew her&mdash;her
      last words, too&mdash;Oh, she was&mdash;she was&mdash;but where&rsquo;s the use
      o&rsquo; sayin&rsquo; what she was?&mdash;I beg your pardon, Ma&rsquo;am,&mdash;your honor,
      sir, &lsquo;ill forgive my want o&rsquo; manners, sure I know it&rsquo;s bad breedin&rsquo;, but I
      can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, promise,&rdquo; said his landlord, &ldquo;to give up drink. Indeed, I wish you
      would take an oath against it: you are a conscientious man, and I know
      would keep it, otherwise I should not propose it, for I discountenance
      such oaths generally. Will you promise me this, Connell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll promise to think of it, your honor,&mdash;aginst takin&rsquo; a sartin
      quantity, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you refuse it, I&rsquo;ll think you are unmindful of the good feeling which
      we have ever shown your family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&mdash;do you think, sir, I&rsquo;m ungrateful to you? That&rsquo;s a sore cut,
      sir, to make a villain o&rsquo; me. Where&rsquo;s the book?&mdash;I&rsquo;ll swear this
      minute. Have you a Bible, Ma&rsquo;am?&mdash;I&rsquo;ll show you that I&rsquo;m not mane,
      any way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Connell, you shall not do it rashly; you must be cool and composed:
      but go home, and turn it in your mind,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;and remember, that
      it is the request of me and my husband, for your own good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither must you swear before me,&rdquo; said his landlord, &ldquo;but before Mr.
      Mulcahy, who, as it is an oath connected with your moral conduct, is the
      best person to be present. It must be voluntary, however. Now, good-bye,
      Connell, and think of what we said; but take care never to carry home any
      of my servants in the same plight in which you put John Smith to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix thin, sir, he had no business, wid your honor&rsquo;s livery upon his
      back, to begin lecthurin&rsquo; me again dhrinkin&rsquo;, as he did. We may all do
      very well, sir, till the timptation crasses us&mdash;but that&rsquo;s what
      thries us. It thried him, but he didn&rsquo;t stand it&mdash;faix he didn&rsquo;t!&mdash;ha,
      ha, ha! Good-mornin&rsquo;, sir&mdash;God bless you, Ma&rsquo;am! Divil resave the
      family in all Europe&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Connell&mdash;good-morning! &mdash;Pray remember what we
      said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter, however, could not relinquish the whiskey. His sons, daughters,
      friends, and neighbors, all assailed him, but with no success. He either
      bantered them in his usual way, or reverted to his loss, and sank into
      sorrow. This last was the condition in which they found him most
      intractable; for a man is never considered to be in a state that admits of
      reasoning or argument, when he is known to be pressed by strong gushes of
      personal feeling. A plan at length struck Father Mulcahy, which lie
      resolved to put into immediate execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t abandon drink, I shall stop the masses
      which I&rsquo;m offering up for the repose of your wife&rsquo;s soul, and I will also
      return you the money I received for saying them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was, perhaps, the only point on which Peter was accessible. He felt
      staggered at such an unexpected intimation, and was for some time silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will then feel,&rdquo; added the priest, &ldquo;that your drunkenness is
      prolonging the sufferings of your wife, and that she is as much concerned
      in your being sober as you are yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will give in,&rdquo; replied Peter; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see the thing in that light. No&mdash;I
      will give it up; but if I swear against it, you must allow me a rasonable
      share every day, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll not go beyant it, of coorse. The truth is, I&rsquo;d
      die soon if I gev it up altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have certainly no objection against that,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;provided
      you keep within what would injure your health, or make you tipsy. Your
      drunkenness is not only sinful but disreputable; besides, you must not
      throw a slur upon the character of your children, who hold respectable and
      rising situations in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Peter, in a kind of soliloquy, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d lay down my life, avoumeen,
      sooner nor I&rsquo;d cause you a minute&rsquo;s sufferin&rsquo;. Father Mulcahy, go an wid
      the masses. I&rsquo;ll get an oath drawn up, an&rsquo; whin it&rsquo;s done, I&rsquo;ll swear to
      it. I know a man that&rsquo;ll do it for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest then departed, quite satisfied with having accomplished his
      object; and Peter, in the course of that evening, directed his steps to
      the house of the village schoolmaster, for the purpose of getting him to
      &ldquo;draw up&rdquo; the intended oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Misther O&rsquo;Flaherty,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m comin&rsquo; to ax a requist of you an&rsquo; I
      hope you&rsquo;ll grant it to me. I brought down a sup in this flask, an&rsquo; while
      we&rsquo;re takin&rsquo; it, we can talk over what I want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it be anything widin the circumference of my power, set it down,
      Misther Connell, as already operated upon. I&rsquo;d drop a pen to no man at
      keepin&rsquo; books by double enthry, which is the Italian method invinted by
      Pope Gregory the Great. The Three sets bear a theological ratio to the
      three states of a thrue Christian. &lsquo;The Waste-book,&rsquo; says Pope Gregory,
      &lsquo;is this world, the Journal is purgatory, an&rsquo; the Ledger is heaven. Or it
      may be compared,&rsquo; he says, in the priface of the work, &lsquo;to the three
      states of the Catholic church&mdash;the church Militant, the church
      Suffering and the church Triumphant.&rsquo; The larnin&rsquo; of that man was beyant
      the reach of credibility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arra, have you a small glass, Masther? You see, Misther O&rsquo;Flaherty, it&rsquo;s
      consarnin&rsquo; purgatory, this that I want to talk about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nancy, get us a glass&mdash;oh, here it is! Thin if it be, it&rsquo;s a wrong
      enthry in the Journal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your health, Masther!&mdash;Not forgetting you, Mrs. O&rsquo;Flaherty.
      No, indeed, thin it&rsquo;s not in the Journal, but an oath I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to take
      against liquor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; is asier to post than it is. We must enter it it undher the head
      of&mdash;let me see!&mdash;it must go in the spirit account, undher the
      head of Profit an&rsquo; Loss, Your good health, Mr. Connell!&mdash;Nancy, I

      undher the&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix, undher the rose, I think,&rdquo; observed Pether; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know the
      smack, of it? You see since I took to it, I like the smell o&rsquo; what I used
      to squeeze out o&rsquo; the barley myself, long ago. Mr. O&rsquo;Flaherty, I only want
      you to dhraw up an oath against liquor for me; but it&rsquo;s not for the books,
      good or bad. I promised to Father Mulcahy, that I&rsquo;d do it. It&rsquo;s regardin&rsquo; 
      my poor Ellish&rsquo;s sowl in purgatory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nancy, hand me a slate an&rsquo; cutter. Faith, the same&rsquo;s a provident
      resolution; but how is it an&rsquo; purgatory concatenated?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The priest, you see, won&rsquo;t go an wid the masses for her till I take the
      oath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s but wake logic, if you ped him for thim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix, an&rsquo; I did&mdash;an&rsquo; well, too;&mdash;but about the oath? Have you
      the pencil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have; jist lave the thing to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Asy, Masther&mdash;you don&rsquo;t undherstand it yit. Put down two tumblers
      for me at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that, Misther Connell?&mdash;It&rsquo;s mysterious, if you&rsquo;re about to
      swear against liquor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am. Put down, as I said, two tumblers for me at home&mdash;Are they
      down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are down&mdash;but&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Asy!&mdash;very good!&mdash;Put down two more for me at Dan&rsquo;s. Let me
      see!&mdash;two more; behind the garden. Well!&mdash;put down one at Father
      Mulcahy&rsquo;s;&mdash;two more at, Frank M&rsquo;Carrol&rsquo;s of Kilclay. How many&rsquo;s
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nine!!!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. Now put down one wid ould&rsquo; Bartle Gorman, of Cargah; an&rsquo; two
      over wid honest Roger M&rsquo;Gaugy, of Nurchasey. How-many have you now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twelve in all!!!! But, Misther Connelly there&rsquo;s a demonstration badly
      wanted here. I must confis I was always bright, but at present I&rsquo;m as dark
      as Nox. I&rsquo;d thank you for a taste of explanation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Asy, man alive! Is there twelve in all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twelve in all: I&rsquo;ve calculated them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll hould to that. Och, och!&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure, avourneen, afore I&rsquo;d
      let you suffer one minute&rsquo;s pain, I&rsquo;d not scruple to take an oath against
      liquor, any way. He may go an wid the masses now for you, as soon as he
      likes! Mr. O&rsquo;Flaherty, will you put that down on paper,&mdash;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
      swear to it, wid a blessin&rsquo;, to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what object do you wish to effectuate by this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Masther, I dhrink one day wid another from a score to two dozen
      tumblers, an&rsquo; I want to swear to no more nor twelve in the twenty-four
      hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s intelligibility in that!&mdash;Wid great pleasure, Mr.
      Connell, I&rsquo;ll indite it. Katty, tare me a lafe out o&rsquo; Brian Murphy&rsquo;s copy
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Masther, it&rsquo;s for Ellish&rsquo;s sake I&rsquo;m doin&rsquo; this. State that in
      the oath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it; an&rsquo; well she desarved that specimen of abstinence from you,
      Misther Connell. Thank you!&mdash;Your health agin! an&rsquo; God grant you
      grace an&rsquo; fortitude to go through wid the same oath!&mdash;An&rsquo; so he will,

     strictly and arithmetically proper and correct.

    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, Misther O&rsquo;Flaherty, it&rsquo;s a dacent oath as it stands. Plase God,
      I&rsquo;ll swear to it some time to-morrow evenin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dacent! Why I don&rsquo;t wish to become eulogistically addicted; but I&rsquo;d back
      tha same oath, for both grammar and arithmetic, aginst any that ever was
      drawn up by a lawyer&mdash;ay, by the great Counsellor himself!&mdash;but
      faith, I&rsquo;d not face him at a Vow, for all that; he&rsquo;s the greatest man at a
      Vow in the three kingdoms.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;, Masther&mdash;as my hand&rsquo;s in, mightn&rsquo;t
      I as well take another wid an ould friend of mine, Owen Smith, of Lisbuy?
      He&rsquo;s a dacent ould residenther, an&rsquo; likes it. It&rsquo;ll make the baker&rsquo;s or
      the long dozen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s not a bad thought; but won&rsquo;t thirteen get into your head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nor three more to the back o&rsquo; that. I only begin to get hearty about
      seventeen, so that the long dozen, afther all, is best; for&mdash;God he
      knows, I&rsquo;ve a regard for Owen Smith this many a year, an&rsquo; I wouldn&rsquo;t wish
      to lave him out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll add it up to the other part of the oath.
    </p>

     &lsquo;Octavo&mdash;One ditto out of respect for dacent Owen Smith, of
          Lisbuy, 1

    <p>
      Now I must make the total amount thirteen, an&rsquo; all will be right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Masther, have you a prayer-book widin?&mdash;bekase if you have, I may as
      well swear here, and you can witness it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Katty, hand over the Spiritual Exercises&mdash;a book aquil to the Bible
      itself for piety an&rsquo; devotion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure they say, Masther, any book that, the name o&rsquo; God&rsquo;s in, is good for
      an oath. Now, wid the help o&rsquo; goodness, repate the words afore me, an&rsquo; 
      I&rsquo;ll sware thim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      O&rsquo;Flaherty hemmed two or three times, and complied with Peter&rsquo;s wishes,
      who followed him in the words until the oath was concluded. He then kissed
      the book, and expressed himself much at ease, as well, he said, upon the
      account of Ellish&rsquo;s soul, as for the sake of his children.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time after this, his oath was the standing jest of the
      neighborhood: even to this day, Peter Connell&rsquo;s oath against liquor is a
      proverb in that part of the country. Immediately after he had sworn, no
      one could ever perceive that he violated it in the slightest degree;
      indeed there could be no doubt as to literally fulfilling it. A day never
      passed in which he did not punctually pay a visit to those whose names
      wore dotted down, with whom he sat, pulled out his flask, and drank his
      quantum. In the meantime the poor man was breaking down rapidly; so much
      so, that his appearance generally excited pity, if not sorrow, among his
      neighbors. His character became simpler every day, and his intellect
      evidently more exhausted. The inoffensive humor, for which he had been
      noted, was also completely on the wane; his eye waxed dim, his step
      feeble, but the benevolence of his heart never failed him. Many acts of
      his private generosity are well known, and still remembered with
      gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      In proportion as the strength of his mind and constitution diminished, so
      did his capacity for bearing liquor. When he first bound himself by the
      oath not to exceed the long dozen, such was his vigor, that the effects of
      thirteen tumblers could scarcely be perceived on him. This state of
      health, however, did not last. As he wore away, the influence of so much
      liquor was becoming stronger, until at length he found that it was more
      than he could bear, that he frequently confounded the names of the men,
      and the number of tumblers mentioned in the oath, and sometimes took in,
      in his route, persons and places not to be found in it at all. This
      grieved him, and he resolved to wait upon O&rsquo;Flaherty for the purpose of
      having some means devised of guiding him during his potations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Masther,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we must thry an&rsquo; make this oath somethin&rsquo; plainer.
      You see when I get confused, I&rsquo;m not able to remimber things as I ought.
      Sometimes, instid o&rsquo; one tumbler, I take two at the wrong place; an&rsquo; sarra
      bit o&rsquo; me but called in an&rsquo; had three wid ould Jack Rogers, that isn&rsquo;t in
      it at all. On another day I had a couple wid honest Barney Casey, an my
      way acrass to Bartle Gorman&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;m not what I was, Masther, ahagm; so I&rsquo;d
      thank you to dhraw it out more clearer, if you can, nor it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, Mr. Connell; I comprehend wid the greatest ase in life, the very
      plan for it. We must reduce the oath to Geography, for I&rsquo;m at home there,
      bein&rsquo; a Surveyor myself. I&rsquo;ll lay down a map o&rsquo; the parish, an&rsquo; draw the
      houses of your friends at their proper places, so that you&rsquo;ll never be out
      o&rsquo; your latitude at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix, I doubt that, Masther&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&rdquo; replied Peter; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afeard
      I will, of an odd time, for I&rsquo;m not able to carry what I used to do; but
      no matther: thry what you can do for me this time, any how. I think I
      could bear the long dozen still if I didn&rsquo;t make mistakes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      O&rsquo;Flaherty accordingly set himself to work; and as his knowledge, not only
      of the parish, but of every person and house in it, was accurate, he soon
      had a tolerably correct skeleton map of it drawn for Peter&rsquo;s use.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;lend me your ears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix, I&rsquo;ll do no sich thing,&rdquo; replied Peter&mdash;&ldquo;I know a thrick worth
      two of it. Lend you my ears, inagh!&mdash;catch me at it! You have a
      bigger pair of your own nor I have&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in other words, pay attintion. Now, see this dot&mdash;that&rsquo;s your
      own house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put a crass there,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;an&rsquo; thin I&rsquo;ll know it&rsquo;s the
      Crass-roads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my reputation, you&rsquo;re right; an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s what I call a good specimen
      of ingenuity. I&rsquo;ll take the hint from that, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll make it a
      Hieroglyphical as well as a Geographical oath. Well, there&rsquo;s a crass, wid
      two tumblers. Is that clear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, it is! faix&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now here we draw a line to your son Dan&rsquo;s. Let me see; he keeps a mill,
      an&rsquo; sells cloth. Very good. I&rsquo;ll dhraw a mill-wheel an&rsquo; a yard-wand.
      There&rsquo;s two tumblers. Will you know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see it: go an, nothin&rsquo; can be clearer. So far, I can&rsquo;t go asthray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what next? Two behind your own garden. What metaphor for the
      garden? Let me see!&mdash;let me cogitate! A dragon&mdash;the Hesperides!
      That&rsquo;s beyant you. A bit of a hedge will do, an&rsquo; a gate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put a gate in, it&rsquo;s not lucky. You know, when a man takes to
      dhrink, they say he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; a gray gate, or a black gate, or a bad gate.
      Put that out, an&rsquo; make the hedge longer, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;ll do&mdash;wid the two
      tumblers, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re down. One at the Reverend Father Mulcahy&rsquo;s. How will we
      thranslate the priest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix, I doubt that will be a difficquilt business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my reputation, I agree wid you in that, especially whin he repates
      Latin. However, we&rsquo;ll see. He writes P.P. afther his name;&mdash;pee-pee
      is what we call the turkeys wid. What &lsquo;ud you think o&rsquo; two turkeys?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The priest would like them roasted, but I couldn&rsquo;t undherstand that. No;
      put down the sign o&rsquo; the horsewhip, or the cudgel; for he&rsquo;s handy, an&rsquo; 
      argues well wid both?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! I&rsquo;ll put down the horsewhip first, an&rsquo; the cudgel alongside of it;
      then the tumbler, an&rsquo; there&rsquo;ll be the sign o&rsquo; the priest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, do, Masther, an&rsquo; faix the priest &lsquo;ll be complate&mdash;there can be
      no mistakin&rsquo; him thin. Divil a one but that&rsquo;s a good thought!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There it is in black an&rsquo; white. Who comes next? Frank M&rsquo;Carroll. He&rsquo;s a
      farmer. I&rsquo;ll put down a spade an&rsquo; a harrow. Well, that&rsquo;s done&mdash;two
      tumblers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t mistake that, aither. It&rsquo;s clear enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bartle Gorman&rsquo;s of Cargah. Bartle&rsquo;s a little lame, an&rsquo; uses a staff wid a
      cross on the end that he houlds in his hand. I&rsquo;ll put down a staff wid a
      cross on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would there be no danger of me mistakin&rsquo; that for the priest&rsquo;s cudgel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divil the slightest. I&rsquo;ll pledge my knowledge of geography, they&rsquo;re two
      very different weapons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, put it down&mdash;I&rsquo;ll know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roger M&rsquo;Gaugy of Nurchasy. What for him? Roger&rsquo;s a pig-driver. I&rsquo;ll put
      down pig. You&rsquo;ll comprehend that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought; for many a pig I sould in my day. Put down the pig; an&rsquo; if you
      could put two black spots upon his back, I&rsquo;d know it to be one I sould him
      about four years agone&mdash;the fattest ever was in the country&mdash;it
      had to be brought home on a car, for it wasn&rsquo;t able to walk wid fat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; the spots are on it. The last is Owen Smith of Lisbuy. Now, do
      you see that I&rsquo;ve drawn a line from place to place, so that you have
      nothing to do only to keep to it as you go. What for Owen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Owen! Let me see&mdash;Owen! Pooh! What&rsquo;s come over me, that I&rsquo;ve nothin&rsquo; 
      for Owen? Ah! I have it. He&rsquo;s a horse-jockey: put down a gray mare I sould
      him about five years agone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put down a horse; but I can&rsquo;t make a gray mare wid black ink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, make a mare of her, any way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, an&rsquo; that same puzzles me. Stop, I have it; I&rsquo;ll put a foal along
      wid her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As good as the bank. God bless you, Misther O&rsquo;Flaherty. I think this &lsquo;ll
      keep me from mistakes. An&rsquo; now, if you&rsquo;ll slip up to me afther dusk, I&rsquo;ll
      send you down a couple o&rsquo; bottles and a flitch. Sure you desarve more for
      the throuble you tuck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Many of our readers, particularly of our English readers, will be somewhat
      startled to hear that, except the change of names and places, there is
      actually little exaggeration in the form of this oath; so just is the
      observation, that the romance of truth frequently exceeds that of fiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter had, however, over-rated his own strength in supposing that he could
      bear the long dozen in future; ere many months passed he was scarcely able
      to reach the half of that number without sinking into intoxication. Whilst
      in this state, he was in the habit of going to the graveyard in which his
      wife lay buried, where he sat, and wept like a child, sang her favorite
      songs, or knelt and offered up his prayers for the repose of her soul.
      None ever mocked him for this; on the contrary, there was always some kind
      person to assist him home. And as he staggered on, instead of sneers and
      ridicule, one might hear such expressions as these:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Pether! he&rsquo;s nearly off; an&rsquo; a dacent, kind neighbor he ever was.
      The death of the wife broke his heart&mdash;he never ris his head since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, poor man! God pity him! Hell soon be sleepin&rsquo; beside her, beyant
      there, where she&rsquo;s lyin&rsquo;. It was never known of Peter Connell that he
      offinded man, woman, or child since he was born, barrin&rsquo; the gaugers, bad
      luck to thim, afore he was marrid&mdash;but that was no offince. Sowl, he
      was their match, any how. When he an&rsquo; the wife&rsquo;s gone, they won&rsquo;t lave
      their likes behind them. The sons are bodaghs&mdash;gintlemen, now; an&rsquo; 
      it&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; but dinners an&rsquo; company. Ahagur, that wasn&rsquo;t the way their
      hardworkin&rsquo; father an&rsquo; mother made the money that they&rsquo;re houldin&rsquo; their
      heads up wid such consequence upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The children, however, did not give Peter up as hopeless. Father Mulcahy,
      too, once-more assailed him on his weak side. One morning, when he was
      sober, nervous, and depressed, the priest arrived, and finding him at
      home, addressed him as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter, I&rsquo;m sorry, and vexed, and angry this morning; and you are the
      cause of it&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that, your Reverence?&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;God help me,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
      be hard an me, sir, for I&rsquo;m to be pitied. Don&rsquo;t be hard on me, for the
      short time I&rsquo;ll be here. I know it won&rsquo;t be long&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be wid her
      soon. Asthore machree, we&rsquo;ll&rsquo; be together, I hope, afore long&mdash;an&rsquo;,
      oh! if it was the will o&rsquo; God, I would be glad if it was afore night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor, shattered, heart-broken creature wept bitterly, for he felt
      somewhat sensible of the justice of the reproof which he expected from the
      priest, as well as undiminished sorrow for his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to be hard on you,&rdquo; said the good-natured priest; &ldquo;I only
      called to tell you a dream that your son Dan had last night about you and
      his mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About Ellish! Oh, for heaven&rsquo;s sake what about her, Father, avourneen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She appeared to him, last night,&rdquo; replied Father Mulcahy, &ldquo;and told him
      that your drinking kept her out of happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Queen of heaven!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter, deeply affected, &ldquo;is that true? Oh,&rdquo;
       said he, dropping on his knees, &ldquo;Father, ahagur machree, pardon me&mdash;oh,
      forgive me! I now promise, solemnly and seriously, to drink neither in the
      house nor out of it, for the time to come, not one drop at all, good, bad,
      or indifferent, of either whiskey, wine, or punch&mdash;barrin&rsquo; one glass.
      Are you now satisfied? an&rsquo; do you think she&rsquo;ll get to happiness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All will be well, I trust,&rdquo; said the priest. &ldquo;I shall mention this to Dan
      and the rest, and depend upon it, they, too, will be happy to hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what Mr. O&rsquo;Flaherty an&rsquo; myself made up,&rdquo; said Peter: &ldquo;burn it,
      Father; take it out of my sight, for it&rsquo;s now no use to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this at all?&rdquo; said Mr. Mulcahy, looking into it. &ldquo;Is it an oath?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Joggraphy of one I swore some time ago; but it&rsquo;s now out of date&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      done wid it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest could not avoid smiling when he perused it, and on getting from
      Peter&rsquo;s lips an explanation of the hieroglyphics, he laughed heartily at
      the ingenious shifts they had made to guide his memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter, for some time after this, confined himself to one glass, as he had
      promised; but he felt such depression and feebleness, that he ventured
      slowly, and by degrees, to enlarge the &ldquo;glass&rdquo; from which he drank. His
      impression touching the happiness of his wife was, that as he had for
      several months strictly observed his promise, she had probably during that
      period gone to heaven. He then began to exercise his ingenuity gradually,
      as we have said, by using, from time to time, a glass larger than the
      preceding one; thus receding from the spirit of his vow to the letter, and
      increasing the quantity of his drink from a small glass to the most
      capacious tumbler he could find. The manner in which he drank this was
      highly illustrative of the customs which prevail on this subject in
      Ireland. He remembered, that in making the vow, he used the words,
      &ldquo;neither in the house nor out of it;&rdquo; but in order to get over this
      dilemma, he usually stood with one foot outside the threshold, and the
      other in the house, keeping himself in that position which would render it
      difficult to determine whether he was either out or in. At other times,
      when he happened to be upstairs, he usually thrust one-half of his person
      out of the window, with the same ludicrous intention of keeping the letter
      of his vow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many a smile this adroitness of his occasioned to the lookers-on: but
      further ridicule was checked by his wobegone and afflicted look. He was
      now a mere skeleton, feeble and tottering.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, in the depth of winter, he went into the town where his two
      sons resided; he had been ill in mind and body during the day, and he
      fancied that change of scene and society might benefit him. His daughter
      and son-in-law, in consequence of his illness, watched him so closely,
      that he could not succeed in getting his usual &ldquo;glass.&rdquo; This offended him,
      and he escaped without their knowledge to the son who kept the inn. On
      arriving there, he went upstairs, and by a douceur to the waiter, got a
      large tumbler filled with spirits. The lingering influences of a
      conscience that generally felt strongly on the side of a moral duty,
      though poorly instructed, prompted him to drink it in the usual manner, by
      keeping one-half of his body, as, nearly as he could guess, out of the
      window, that it might be said he drank it neither in nor out of the house.
      He had scarcely finished his draught, however, when he lost his balance,
      and was precipitated upon the pavement. The crash of his fall was heard in
      the bar, and his son, who had just come in, ran, along with several
      others, to ascertain what had happened. They found him, however, only
      severely stunned. He was immediately brought in, and medical aid sent for;
      but, though he recovered from the immediate effects of the fall, the shock
      it gave to his broken constitution, and his excessive grief, carried him
      off in a few months afterwards. He expired in the arms of his son and
      daughter, and amidst the tears of those who knew his simplicity of
      character, his goodness of heart, and his attachment to the wife by whose
      death that heart had been broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the melancholy end of the honest and warm-hearted Peter Connell,
      who, unhappily, was not a solitary instance of a man driven to habits of
      intoxication and neglect of business by the force of sorrow, which time
      and a well-regulated mind might otherwise have overcome. We have held him
      up, on the one hand, as an example worthy of imitation in that industry
      and steadiness which, under the direction of his wife, raised him from
      poverty to independence and wealth; and, on the other, as a man resorting
      to the use of spirituous liquors that he might be enabled to support
      affliction&mdash;a course which, so far from having sustained him under
      it, shattered his constitution, shortened his life, and destroyed his
      happiness. In conclusion, we wish our countrymen of Peter&rsquo;s class would
      imitate him in his better qualities, and try to avoid his failings.

    <h2>
      THE LIANHAN SHEE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      One summer evening Mary Sullivan was sitting at her own well-swept
      hearthstone, knitting feet to a pair of sheep&rsquo;s gray stockings for
      Bartley, her husband. It was one of those serene evenings in the month of
      June, when the decline of day assumes a calmness and repose, resembling
      what we might suppose to have irradiated Eden, when our first parents sat
      in it before their fall. The beams of the sun shone through the windows in
      clear shafts of amber light, exhibiting millions of those atoms which
      float to the naked eye within its mild radiance. The dog lay barking in
      his dreams at her feet, and the gray cat sat purring placidly upon his
      back, from which even his occasional agitation did not dislodge her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sullivan was the wife of a wealthy farmer, and niece to the Rev.
      Felix O&rsquo;Rourke; her kitchen was consequently large, comfortable, and warm.
      Over where she sat, jutted out the &ldquo;brace&rdquo; well lined with bacon; to the
      right hung a well-scoured salt-box, and to the left was the jamb, with its
      little gothic paneless window to admit the light. Within it hung several
      ash rungs, seasoning for flail-sooples, or boulteens, a dozen of
      eel-skins, and several stripes of horse-skin, as hangings for them. The
      dresser was a &ldquo;parfit white,&rdquo; and well furnished with the usual
      appurtenances. Over the door and on the &ldquo;threshel,&rdquo; were nailed, &ldquo;for
      luck,&rdquo; two horse-shoes, that had been found by accident. In a little
      &ldquo;hole&rdquo; in the wall, beneath the salt-box, lay a bottle of holy water to
      keep the place purified; and against the cope-stone of the gable, on the
      outside, grew a large lump of house-leek, as a specific for sore eyes and
      other maladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the corner of the garden were a few stalks of tansy &ldquo;to kill the
      thievin&rsquo; worms in the childhre, the crathurs,&rdquo; together with a little
      Rose-noble, Solomon&rsquo;s Seal, and Bu-gloss, each for some medicinal purpose.
      The &ldquo;lime wather&rdquo; Mrs. Sullivan could make herself, and the &ldquo;bog bane&rdquo; for
      the Unh roe, (* Literally, red water) or heart-burn, grew in their own
      meadow drain; so that, in fact, she had within her reach a very decent
      pharmacopoeia, perhaps as harmless as that of the profession itself. Lying
      on the top of the salt-box was a bunch of fairy flax, and sewed in the
      folds of her own scapular was the dust of what had once been a four-leaved
      shamrock, an invaluable specific &ldquo;for seein&rsquo; the good people,&rdquo; if they
      happened to come within the bounds of vision. Over the door in the inside,
      over the beds, and over the cattle in the outhouses, were placed branches
      of withered palm, that had been consecrated by the priest on Palm Sunday;
      and when the cows happened to calve, this good woman tied, with her own
      hands, a woollen thread about their tails, to prevent them from being
      overlooked by evil eyes, or elf-shot* by the fairies, who seem to possess
      a peculiar power over females of every species during the period of
      parturition. It is unnecessary to mention the variety of charms which she
      possessed for that obsolete malady the colic, the toothache, headache, or
      for removing warts, and taking motes out of the eyes; let it suffice to
      inform our readers that she was well stocked with them; and that, in
      addition to this, she, together with her husband, drank a potion made up
      and administered by an herb-doctor, for preventing forever the slightest
      misunderstanding or quarrel between man and wife. Whether it produced this
      desirable object or not our readers may conjecture, when we add, that the
      herb-doctor, after having taken a very liberal advantage of their
      generosity, was immediately compelled to disappear from the neighborhood,
      in order to avoid meeting with Bartley, who had a sharp lookout for him,
      not exactly on his own account, but &ldquo;in regard,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that it had no
      effect upon Mary, at all, at all;&rdquo; whilst Mary, on the other hand,
      admitted its efficacy upon herself, but maintained, &ldquo;that Bartley was
      worse nor ever afther it.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * This was, and in remote parts of the country still
     is, one of the strongest instances of belief in the
     power of the Fairies. The injury, which, if not
     counteracted by a charm from the lips of a &ldquo;Fairy-man,&rdquo;
      or &ldquo;Fairy-woman,&rdquo; was uniformly inflicted on the animal
     by what was termed an elf-stone&mdash;which was nothing
     more nor less than a piece of sharp flint, from three
     to four or five ounces in weight. The cow was supposed
     to be struck upon the loin with it by these mischievous
     little beings, and the nature of the wound was indeed
     said to be very peculiar&mdash;that is, it cut the midriff
     without making any visible or palpable wound on the
     outward skin. All animals dying of this complaint,
     were supposed to be carried to the good people, and
     there are many in the country who would not believe
     that the dead carcass of the cow was that of the real
     one at all, but an old log or block of wood, made to
     resemble it. All such frauds, however, and deceptions
     were inexplicable to every one, but such as happened to
     possess a four-leaved shamrock, and this enabled its
     possessor to see the block or log in its real shape,
     although to others it appeared to be the real carcass.
</pre>
    <p>
      Such was Mary Sullivan, as she sat at her own hearth, quite alone, engaged
      as we have represented her. What she may have been meditating on we cannot
      pretend to ascertain; but after some time, she looked sharply into the
      &ldquo;backstone,&rdquo; or hob, with an air of anxiety and alarm. By and by she
      suspended her knitting, and listened with much earnestness, leaning her
      right ear over to the hob, from whence the sounds to which she paid such
      deep attention proceeded. At length she crossed herself devoutly, and
      exclaimed, &ldquo;Queen of saints about us!&mdash;is it back ye are? Well sure
      there&rsquo;s no use in talkin&rsquo;, bekase they say you know what&rsquo;s said of you, or
      to you&mdash;an&rsquo; we may as well spake yez fair.&mdash;Hem&mdash;musha, yez
      are welcome back, crickets, avourneenee! I hope that, not like the last
      visit ye ped us, yez are comin&rsquo; for luck now! Moolyeen (* a cow without
      horns) died, any way, soon afther your other kailyee, (* short visit) ye
      crathurs ye. Here&rsquo;s the bread, an&rsquo; the salt, an&rsquo; the male for yez, an&rsquo; we
      wish ye well. Eh?&mdash;saints above, if it isn&rsquo;t listenin&rsquo; they are jist
      like a Christhien! Wurrah, but ye are the wise an&rsquo; the quare crathurs all
      out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then shook a little holy water over the hob, and muttered to herself
      an Irish charm or prayer against the evils which crickets are often
      supposed by the peasantry to bring with them, and requested, still in the
      words of the charm, that their presence might, on that occasion, rather be
      a presage of good fortune to man and beast belonging to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There now, ye <i>dhonans</i> (* a diminuitive, delicate little thing) ye,
      sure ye can&rsquo;t say that ye&rsquo;re ill-thrated here, anyhow, or ever was mocked
      or made game of in the same family. You have got your hansel, an&rsquo; full an&rsquo; 
      plenty of it; hopin&rsquo; at the same time that you&rsquo;ll have no rason in life to
      cut our best clothes from revinge. Sure an&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t desarve to have my
      brave stuff long body (* an old-fashioned Irish gown) riddled the way it
      was, the last time ye wor here, an&rsquo; only bekase little Barny, that has but
      the sinse of a gorsoon, tould yez in a joke to pack off wid yourself
      somewhere else. Musha, never heed what the likes of him says; sure he&rsquo;s
      but a caudy, (* little boy) that doesn&rsquo;t mane ill, only the bit o&rsquo; 
      divarsion wid yez.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then resumed her knitting, occasionally stopping, as she changed her
      needles, to listen, with her ear set, as if she wished to augur from the
      nature of their chirping, whether they came for good or for evil. This,
      however, seemed to be beyond her faculty of translating their language;
      for&mdash;after sagely shaking her head two or three times, she knit more
      busily than before.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Of the origin of this singular superstition I can
     find no account whatsoever; it is conceived, however,
     in a mild, sweet, and hospitable spirit. The visits of
     these migratory little creatures, which may be termed
     domestic grasshoppers, are very capricious and
     uncertain, as are their departures; and it is, I should
     think, for this reason, that they are believed to be
     cognizant of the ongoings of human life. We can easily
     suppose, for instance, that the coincidence of their
     disappearance from a family, and the occurrence of a
     death in that family, frequently multiplied as such
     coincidences must be in the country at large, might
     occasion the people, who are naturally credulous, to
     associate the one event with the other; and on that
     slight basis erect the general superstition. Crickets,
     too, when chirupping, have a habit of suddenly ceasing,
     so that when any particularly interesting conversation
     happens to go on about the rustic hearth, this stopping
     of their little chaunt looks so like listening, that it
     is scarcely to be wondered at that the country folks
     think they understand every word that is spoken. They
     are thought, also, to foresee both good and evil, and
     are considered vindictive, but yet capable of being
     conciliated by fair words and kindness. They are also
     very destructive among wearing-apparel, which they
     frequently nibble into holes; and this is always looked
     upon as a piece of revenge, occasioned by some
     disrespectful language used towards them, or some
     neglect of their little wants. This note was necessary
     in order to render the conduct and language of Mary
     Sullivan perfectly intelligible.
</pre>
    <p>
      At this moment, the shadow of a person passing the house darkened the
      window opposite which she sat, and immediately a tall female, of a wild
      dress and aspect, entered the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Gho manhy dhea ghud, a ban chohr!</i> the blessin&rsquo; o&rsquo; goodness upon
      you, dacent woman,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sullivan, addressing her in those kindly
      phrases so peculiar to the Irish language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of making her any reply, however, the woman, whose eye glistened
      with a wild depth of meaning, exclaimed in low tones, apparently of much
      anguish, &ldquo;<i>Husht, husht&rsquo;, dherum!</i> husht, husht, I say&mdash;let me
      alone&mdash;I will do it&mdash;will you husht? I will, I say&mdash;I will&mdash;there
      now&mdash;that&rsquo;s it&mdash;be quiet, an&rsquo; I will do it&mdash;be quiet!&rdquo; and
      as she thus spoke, she turned her face back over her left shoulder, as if
      some invisible being dogged her steps, and stood bending over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Gho manhy dhea ghud, a ban chohr, dherhum areesh!</i> the blessin&rsquo; o&rsquo; 
      God on you, honest woman, I say again,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sullivan, repeating that
      sacred form of salutation with which the peasantry address each other.
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis a fine evenin&rsquo;, honest woman, glory be to him that sent the same,
      and amin! If it was cowld, I&rsquo;d be axin&rsquo; you to draw your chair in to the
      fire: but, any way, won&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she ceased speaking, the piercing eye of the strange woman became
      riveted on her with a glare, which, whilst it startled Mrs. Sullivan,
      seemed full of an agony that almost abstracted her from external life. It
      was not, however, so wholly absorbing as to prevent it from expressing a
      marked interest, whether for good or evil, in the woman who addressed her
      so hospitably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Husht, now&mdash;husht,&rdquo; she said, as if aside&mdash;&ldquo;husht, won&rsquo;t you&mdash;sure
      I may speak the thing to her&mdash;you said it&mdash;there now, husht!&rdquo;
       And then fastening her dark eyes on Mrs. Sullivan, she smiled bitterly and
      mysteriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you well,&rdquo; she said, without, however, returning the blessing
      contained in the usual reply to Mrs. Sullivan&rsquo;s salutation&mdash;&ldquo;I know
      you well, Mary Sullivan&mdash;husht, now, husht&mdash;yes, I know you
      well, and the power of all that you carry about you; but you&rsquo;d be better
      than you are&mdash;and that&rsquo;s well enough now&mdash;if you had sense to
      know&mdash;ah, ah, ah!&mdash;what&rsquo;s this!&rdquo; she exclaimed abruptly, with
      three distinct shrieks, that seemed to be produced by sensations of sharp
      and piercing agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of goodness, what&rsquo;s over you, honest woman?&rdquo; inquired Mrs.
      Sullivan, as she started from her chair, and ran to her in a state of
      alarm, bordering on terror&mdash;&ldquo;Is it sick you are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman&rsquo;s face had got haggard, and its features distorted; but in a few
      minutes they resumed their peculiar expression of settled wildness and
      mystery. &ldquo;Sick!&rdquo; she replied, licking her parched lips, &ldquo;awirck, awirek!
      look! look!&rdquo; and she pointed with a shudder that almost convulsed her
      whole frame, to a lump that rose on her shoulders; this, be it what it
      might, was covered with a red cloak, closely pinned and tied with great
      caution about her body&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;tis here! I have it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blessed mother!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Sullivan, tottering over to her chair, as
      finished a picture of horror as the eye could witness, &ldquo;this day&rsquo;s Friday:
      the saints stand betwixt me an&rsquo; all harm! Oh, holy Mary protect me! <i>Nhanim
      an airh</i>,&rdquo; in the name of the Father, etc., and she forthwith proceeded
      to bless herself, which she did thirteen times in honor of the blessed
      virgin and the twelve apostles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, it&rsquo;s as you see!&rdquo; replied the stranger, bitterly. &ldquo;It is here&mdash;husht,
      now&mdash;husht, I say&mdash;I will say the thing to her, mayn&rsquo;t I? Ay,
      indeed, Mary Sullivan, &lsquo;tis with me always&mdash;always. Well, well, no, I
      won&rsquo;t. I won&rsquo;t&mdash;easy. Oh, blessed saints, easy, and I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Mrs. Sullivan had uncorked a bottle of holy water, and
      plentifully bedewed herself with it, as a preservative against this
      mysterious woman and her dreadful secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blessed mother above!&rdquo; she ejaculated, &ldquo;the <i>Lianhan Shee</i>&rdquo; And as
      she spoke, with the holy water in the palm of her hand, she advanced
      cautiously, and with great terror, to throw it upon the stranger and the
      unearthly thing she bore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t attempt it!&rdquo; shouted the other, in tones of mingled fierceness and
      terror, &ldquo;do you want to give me pain without keeping yourself anything at
      all safer? Don&rsquo;t you know it doesn&rsquo;t care about your holy water? But I&rsquo;d
      suffer for it, an&rsquo; perhaps so would you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sullivan, terrified by the agitated looks of the woman, drew back
      with affright, and threw the holy water with which she intended to purify
      the other on her own person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why thin, you lost crathur, who or what are you at all?&mdash;don&rsquo;t,
      don&rsquo;t&mdash;for the sake of all the saints and angels of heaven, don&rsquo;t
      come next or near me&mdash;keep your distance&mdash;but what are you, or
      how did you come to get that &lsquo;good thing&rsquo; you carry about wid you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, indeed!&rdquo; replied the woman bitterly, &ldquo;as if I would or could tell you
      that! I say, you woman, you&rsquo;re doing what&rsquo;s not right in asking me a
      question you ought not let to cross your lips&mdash;look to yourself, and
      what&rsquo;s over you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The simple woman, thinking her meaning literal, almost leaped off her seat
      with terror, and turned up her eyes to ascertain whether or not any
      dreadful appearance had approached her, or hung over her where she sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Woman,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I spoke you kind an&rsquo; fair, an&rsquo; I wish you well&mdash;but&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what?&rdquo; replied the other&mdash;and her eyes kindled into deep and
      profound excitement, apparently upon very slight grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;hem&mdash;nothin&rsquo; at all sure, only&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only what?&rdquo; asked the stranger, with a face of anguish that seemed to
      torture every feature out of its proper lineaments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dacent woman,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sullivan, whilst the hair began to stand with
      terror upon her head, &ldquo;sure it&rsquo;s no wondher in life that I&rsquo;m in a
      perplexity, whin a <i>Lianhan Shee</i> is undher the one roof wid me.
      &lsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t that I want to know anything&rsquo; at all about it&mdash;the dear
      forbid I should; but I never hard of a person bein&rsquo; tormented wid it as
      you are. I always used to hear the people say that it thrated its friends
      well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Husht!&rdquo; said the woman, looking wildly over her shoulder, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not tell:
      it&rsquo;s on myself I&rsquo;ll leave the blame! Why, will you never pity me? Am I to
      be night and day tormented? Oh, you&rsquo;re wicked an&rsquo; cruel for no reason!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thry,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sullivan, &ldquo;an&rsquo; bless yourself; call on God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; shouted the other, &ldquo;are you going to get me killed?&rdquo; and as she
      uttered the words, a spasmodic working which must have occasioned great
      pain, even to torture, became audible in her throat: her bosom heaved up
      and down, and her head was bent repeatedly on her breast, as if by force.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention that name,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;in my presence, except you mean to
      drive me to utter distraction. I mean,&rdquo; she continued, after a
      considerable effort to recover her former tone and manner&mdash;&ldquo;hear me
      with attention&mdash;I mean, woman&mdash;you, Mary Sullivan&mdash;that if
      you mention that holy name, you might as well keep plunging sharp knives
      into my heart! Husht! peace to me for one minute, tormentor! Spare me
      something, I&rsquo;m in your power!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you ate anything?&rdquo; said Mrs. Sullivan; &ldquo;poor crathur, you look like
      hunger an&rsquo; distress; there&rsquo;s enough in the house, blessed be them that
      sent it! an&rsquo; you had betther thry an&rsquo; take some nourishment, any way;&rdquo; and
      she raised her eyes in a silent prayer of relief and ease for the unhappy
      woman, whose unhallowed association had, in her opinion, sealed her doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will I?&mdash;will I?&mdash;oh!&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;may you never know misery
      for offering it! Oh, bring me something&mdash;some refreshment&mdash;some
      food&mdash;for I&rsquo;m dying with hunger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sullivan, who, with all her superstition, was remarkable for charity
      and benevolence, immediately placed food and drink before her, which the
      stranger absolutely devoured&mdash;taking care occasionally to secrete
      under the protuberance which appeared behind her neck, a portion of what
      she ate. This, however, she did, not by stealth, but openly; merely taking
      means to prevent the concealed thing, from being, by any possible accident
      discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the craving of hunger was satisfied, she appeared to suffer less from
      the persecution of her tormentor than, before; whether it was, as Mrs.
      Sullivan thought, that the food with which she plied it, appeased in some
      degree its irritability, or lessened that of the stranger, it was
      difficult to say; at all events, she became more composed; her eyes
      resumed somewhat of a natural expression; each sharp ferocious glare,
      which shot, from them! with such intense and rapid flashes, partially
      disappeared; her knit brows dilated, and part of a forehead, which had
      once been capacious and handsome, lost the contractions which deformed it
      by deep wrinkles. Altogether the change was evident, and very-much
      relieved Mrs. Sullivan, who could not avoid observing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that I care much about it, if you&rsquo;d think it not right o&rsquo; me,
      but it&rsquo;s odd enough for you to keep the lower part of your face muffled up
      in that black cloth, an&rsquo; then your forehead, too, is covered down on your
      face a bit? If they&rsquo;re part of the bargain,&rdquo;&mdash;and she shuddered at
      the thought&mdash;&ldquo;between you an&rsquo; anything that&rsquo;s not good&mdash;hem!&mdash;I
      think you&rsquo;d do well to throw thim off o&rsquo; you, an&rsquo; turn to thim that can
      protect you from everything that&rsquo;s bad. Now a scapular would keep all the
      divils in hell from one; an&rsquo; if you&rsquo;d&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      On looking at the stranger she hesitated, for the wild expression of her
      eyes began to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t begin my punishment again,&rdquo; replied the woman; &ldquo;make no allus&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      make mention in my presence of anything that&rsquo;s good. Husht,&mdash;husht,&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      beginning&mdash;easy now&mdash;easy! No,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I came to tell you,
      that only for my breakin&rsquo; a vow I made to this thing upon me, I&rsquo;d be happy
      instead of miserable with it. I say, it&rsquo;s a good thing to have, if the
      person will use this bottle,&rdquo; she added, producing one, &ldquo;as I will direct
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t wish, for my part,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Sullivan, &ldquo;to have anything
      to do wid it&mdash;neither act nor part;&rdquo; and she crossed herself
      devoutly, on contemplating such an unholy alliance as that at which her
      companion hinted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary Sullivan,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;I can put good fortune and happiness
      in the way of you and yours. It is for you the good is intended; if you
      don&rsquo;t get both, no other can,&rdquo; and her eyes kindled as she spoke, like
      those of the Pythoness in the moment of inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sullivan looked at her with awe, fear, and a strong mixture of
      curiosity; she had often heard that the <i>Lianhan Shee</i> had, through
      means of the person to whom it was bound, conferred wealth upon several,
      although it could never render this important service to those who
      exercised direct authority over it. She therefore experienced something
      like a conflict between her fears and a love of that wealth, the
      possession of which was so plainly intimated to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The money,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;would be one thing, but to have the <i>Lianhan
      Shee</i> planted over a body&rsquo;s shouldher&mdash;och; the saints preserve
      us!&mdash;no, not for oceans&rsquo; of hard goold would I have it in my company
      one minnit. But in regard to the money&mdash;hem!&mdash;why, if it could
      be managed widout havin&rsquo; act or part wid that thing, people would do
      anything in rason and fairity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have this day been kind to me,&rdquo; replied the woman, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s what I
      can&rsquo;t say of many&mdash;dear help me!&mdash;husht! Every door is shut in
      my face! Does not every cheek get pale when I am seen? If I meet a
      fellow-creature on the road, they turn into the field to avoid me; if I
      ask for food, it&rsquo;s to a deaf ear I speak; if I am thirsty, they send me to
      the river. What house would shelter me? In cold, in hunger, in drought, in
      storm, and in tempest, I am alone and unfriended, hated, feared, an&rsquo; 
      avoided; starving in the winter&rsquo;s cold, and burning in the summer&rsquo;s heat.
      All this is my fate here; and&mdash;oh! oh! oh!&mdash;have mercy,
      tormentor&mdash;have mercy! I will not lift my thoughts there&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      keep the paction&mdash;but spare me now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned round as she spoke, seeming to follow an invisible object, or,
      perhaps, attempting to get a more complete view of the mysterious being
      which exercised such a terrible and painful influence over her. Mrs.
      Sullivan, also, kept her eye fixed upon the lump, and actually believed
      that she saw it move. Fear of incurring the displeasure of what it
      contained, and a superstitious reluctance harshly to thrust a person from
      her door who had eaten of her food, prevented her from desiring the woman
      to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of Goodness,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I will have nothing to do wid
      your gift. Providence, blessed be his name, has done well for me an&rsquo; mine,
      an&rsquo; it mightn&rsquo;t be right to go beyant what it has pleased him to give me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A rational sentiment!&mdash;I mean there&rsquo;s good sense in what you say,&rdquo;
       answered the stranger: &ldquo;but you need not be afraid,&rdquo; and she accompanied
      the expression by holding up the bottle and kneeling: &ldquo;now,&rdquo; she added,
      &ldquo;listen to me, and judge for yourself, if what I say, when I swear it, can
      be a lie.&rdquo; She then proceeded to utter oaths of the most solemn nature,
      the purport of which Was to assure Mrs. Sullivan that drinking of the
      bottle would be attended with no danger. &ldquo;You see this little bottle,
      drink it. Oh, for my sake and your own drink it; it will give wealth
      without end to you and to all belonging to you. Take one-half of it before
      sunrise, and the other half when he goes down. You must stand while
      drinking it, with your face to the east, in the morning; and at night, to
      the west. Will you promise to do this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How would drinkin&rsquo; the bottle get me money?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Sullivan, who
      certainly felt a strong tendency of heart to the wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I can&rsquo;t tell you now, nor would you understand it, even if I could;
      but you will know all when what I say is complied with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep your bottle, dacent woman. I wash my hands of it: the saints above
      guard me from the timptation! I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not right, for as I&rsquo;m a
      sinner, &lsquo;tis getting stronger every minute widin me? Keep it! I&rsquo;m loth to
      bid any one that ett o&rsquo; my bread to go from my hearth, but if you go, I&rsquo;ll
      make it worth your while. Saints above, what&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; over me. In my whole
      life I never had such a hankerin&rsquo; afther money! Well, well, but it&rsquo;s quare
      entirely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you drink it?&rdquo; asked her companion. &ldquo;If it does hurt or harm to you
      or yours, or anything but good, may what is hanging over me be fulfilled!&rdquo;
       and she extended a thin, but, considering her years, not ungraceful arm,
      in the act of holding out the bottle to her kind entertainer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the sake of all that&rsquo;s good and gracious take it without scruple&mdash;it
      is not hurtful, a child might drink every drop that&rsquo;s in it. Oh, for the
      sake of all you love, and of all that love you, take it!&rdquo; and as she urged
      her, the tears streamed down her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Sullivan, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll never cross my lips; not if it
      made me as rich as ould Hendherson, that airs his guineas in the sun, for
      fraid they&rsquo;d get light by lyin&rsquo; past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I entreat you to take it?&rdquo; said the strange woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, never!&mdash;once for all&mdash;I say, I won&rsquo;t; so spare your
      breath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The firmness of the good housewife was not, in fact to be shaken; so,
      after exhausting all the motives and arguments with which she could urge
      the accomplishments of her design, the strange woman, having again put the
      bottle into her bosom, prepared to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had now once more become calm, and resumed her seat with the languid
      air of one who has suffered much exhaustion and excitement. She put her
      hand upon her forehead for a few moments, as if collecting her faculties,
      or endeavoring to remember the purport of their previous conversation. A
      slight moisture had broken through her skin, and altogether,
      notwithstanding her avowed criminality in entering into an unholy bond,
      she appeared an object of deep compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment her manner changed again, and her eyes blazed out once more,
      as she asked her alarmed hostess:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again, Mary Sullivan, will you take the gift that I have it in my power
      to give you? ay or no? speak, poor mortal, if you know what is for your
      own good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sullivan&rsquo;s fears, however, had overcome her love of money,
      particularly as she thought that wealth obtained in such a manner could
      not prosper; her only objection being to the means of acquiring it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;am I doomed never to meet with any one who will
      take the promise off me by drinking of this bottle? Oh! but I am unhappy!
      What it is to fear&mdash;ah! ah!&mdash;and keep his commandments. Had I
      done so in my youthful time, I wouldn&rsquo;t now&mdash;ah&mdash;merciful
      mother, is there no relief? kill me, tormentor; kill me outright, for
      surely the pangs of eternity cannot be greater than those you now make me
      suffer. Woman,&rdquo; said she, and her muscles stood out in extraordinary
      energy&mdash; &ldquo;woman, Mary Sullivan&mdash;ay, if you should kill me&mdash;blast
      me&mdash;where I stand, I will say the word&mdash;woman&mdash;you have
      daughters&mdash;teach them&mdash;to fear-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having got so far, she stopped&mdash;her bosom heaved up and down&mdash;her
      frame shook dreadfully&mdash;her eyeballs became lurid and fiery&mdash;her
      hands were clenched, and the spasmodic throes of inward convulsion worked
      the white froth up to her mouth; at length she suddenly became like a
      statue, with this wild, supernatural expression intense upon her, and with
      an awful calmness, by far more dreadful than excitement could be,
      concluded by pronouncing, in deep, husky tones, the name of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having accomplished this with such a powerful struggle, she turned round,
      with pale despair in her countenance and manner, and with streaming eyes
      slowly departed, leaving Mrs. Sullivan in a situation not at all to be
      envied.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a short time the other members of the family, who had been out at their
      evening employments, returned. Bartley, her husband, having entered
      somewhat sooner than his three daughters from milking, was the first to
      come in; presently the girls followed, and in a few minutes they sat down
      to supper, together with the servants, who dropped in one by one, after
      the toil of the day. On placing themselves about the table, Bartley, as
      usual, took his seat at the head; but Mrs. Sullivan, instead of occupying
      hers, sat at the fire in a state of uncommon agitation. Every two or three
      minutes she would cross herself devoutly, and mutter such prayers against
      spiritual influences of an evil nature, as she could compose herself to
      remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thin, why don&rsquo;t you come to your supper, Mary,&rdquo; said the husband, &ldquo;while
      the sowans are warm? Brave and thick they are this night, any way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife was silent; for so strong a hold had the strange woman and her
      appalling secret upon her mind, that it was not till he repeated his
      question three or four times&mdash;raising his head with surprise, and
      asking, &ldquo;Eh, thin, Mary, what&rsquo;s come over you&mdash;is it unwell you are?&rdquo;&mdash;that
      she noticed what he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supper!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;unwell! &lsquo;tis a good right I have to be unwell,&mdash;I
      hope nothin&rsquo; bad will happen, any way. Feel my face, Nanny,&rdquo; she added,
      addressing one of her daughters, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s as cowld an&rsquo; wet as a lime-stone&mdash;ay,
      an&rsquo; if you found me a corpse before you, it wouldn&rsquo;t be at all strange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a general pause at the seriousness of this intimation. The
      husband rose from his supper, and went up to the hearth where she sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn round to the light,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;why, Mary dear, in the name of
      wondher, what ails you? for you&rsquo;re like a corpse, sure enough. Can&rsquo;t you
      tell us what has happened, or what put you in such a state? Why, childhre,
      the cowld sweat&rsquo;s teemin&rsquo; off her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor woman, unable to sustain the shock produced by her interview with
      the stranger, found herself getting more weak, and requested a drink of
      water; but before it could be put to her lips, she laid her head upon the
      back of the chair and fainted. Grief, and uproar, and confusion followed
      this alarming incident. The presence of mind, so necessary on such
      occasions, was wholly lost; one ran here, and another there, all jostling
      against each other, without being cool enough to render her proper
      assistance. The daughters were in tears, and Bartley himself was
      dreadfully shocked by seeing his wife apparently lifeless before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She soon recovered, however, and relieved them from the apprehension of
      her death, which they thought had actually taken place. &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; said the
      husband, &ldquo;something quare entirely has happened, or you wouldn&rsquo;t be in
      this state!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did any of you see a strange woman lavin&rsquo; the house, a minute or two
      before ye came in?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; they replied, &ldquo;not a stim of any one did we see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Wurrah dheelish!</i> No?&mdash;now is it possible ye didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; She then
      described her, but all declared they had seen no such person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bartley, whisper,&rdquo; said she, and beckoning him over to her, in a few
      words she revealed the secret. The husband grew pale, and crossed himself.
      &ldquo;Mother of Saints! childhre,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;a <i>Lianhan Shee!</i>&rdquo; The words
      were no sooner uttered than every countenance assumed the pallidness of
      death: and every right hand was raised in the act of blessing the person,
      and crossing the forehead. &ldquo;The <i>Lianhan Shee!!</i>&rdquo; all exclaimed in
      fear and horror&mdash;&ldquo;This day&rsquo;s Friday, God betwixt us an&rsquo; harm!&rdquo;*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * This short form is supposed to be a safeguard against
     the Fairies. The particular day must be always named.
</pre>
    <p>
      It was now after dusk, and the hour had already deepened into the darkness
      of a calm, moonless, summer night; the hearth, therefore, in a short time,
      became surrounded by a circle, consisting of every person in the house;
      the door was closed and securely bolted;&mdash;a struggle for the safest
      seat took place, and to Bartley&rsquo;s shame be it spoken, he lodged himself on
      the hob within the jamb, as the most distant situation from the fearful
      being known as the <i>Lianhan Shee</i>. The recent terror, however,
      brooded over them all; their topic of conversation was the mysterious
      visit, of which Mrs. Sullivan gave a painfully accurate detail; whilst
      every ear of those who composed her audience was set, and every single
      hair of their heads bristled up, as if awakened into distinct life by the
      story. Bartley looked into the fire soberly, except when the cat, in
      prowling about the dresser, electrified him into a start of fear, which
      sensation went round every link of the living chain about the hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day the story spread through the whole neighborhood, accumulating
      in interest and incident as it went. Where it received the touches,
      embellishments, and emendations, with which it was amplified, it would be
      difficult to say; every one told it, forsooth, exactly as he heard it from
      another; but indeed it is not improbable, that those through whom it
      passed were unconscious of the additions it had received at their hands.
      It is not unreasonable to suppose that imagination in such cases often
      colors highly without a premeditated design of falsehood. Fear and dread,
      however, accompanied its progress; such families as had neglected to keep
      holy water in their houses borrowed some from their neighbors; every old
      prayer which had become rusty from disuse, was brightened up&mdash;charms
      were hung about the necks of cattle&mdash;and gospels about those of
      children&mdash;crosses were placed over the doors and windows;&mdash;no
      unclean water was thrown out before sunrise or after dusk&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;E&rsquo;en those prayed now who never prayed before.
     And those who always prayed, still prayed the more.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The inscrutable woman who caused such general dismay in the parish was an
      object of much pity. Avoided, feared, and detested, she could find no rest
      for her weary feet, nor any shelter for her unprotected head. If she was
      seen approaching a house, the door and windows were immediately closed
      against her; if met on the way she was avoided as a pestilence. How she
      lived no one could tell, for none would permit themselves to know. It was
      asserted that she existed without meat or drink, and that she was doomed
      to remain possessed of life, the prey of hunger and thirst, until she
      could get some one weak enough to break the spell by drinking her hellish
      draught, to taste which, they said, would be to change places with
      herself, and assume her despair and misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had lived in the country about six months before her appearance in
      it, a man named Stephenson. He was unmarried, and the last of his family.
      This person led a solitary and secluded life, and exhibited during the
      last years of his existence strong symptoms of eccentricity, which, for
      some months before his death, assumed a character of unquestionable
      derangement. He was found one morning hanging by a halter in his own
      stable, where he had, under the influence of his malady, committed
      suicide. At this time the public press had not, as now, familiarized the
      minds of the people to that dreadful crime, and it was consequently looked
      upon then with an intensity of horror, of which we can scarcely entertain
      any adequate notion. His farm remained unoccupied, for while an acre of
      land could be obtained in any other quarter, no man would enter upon such
      unhallowed premises. The house was locked up, and it was currently
      reported that Stephenson and the devil each night repeated the hanging
      scene in the stable; and that when the former was committing the &ldquo;hopeless
      sin,&rdquo; the halter slipped several times from the beam of the stable-loft,
      when Satan came, in the shape of a dark complexioned man with a hollow
      voice, and secured the rope until Stephenson&rsquo;s end was accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this stable did the wanderer take up her residence at night; and when
      we consider the belief of the people in the night-scenes, which were
      supposed to occur in it, we need not be surprised at the new feature of
      horror which this circumstance super-added to her character. Her presence
      and appearance, in the parish were dreadful; a public outcry was soon
      raised against her, which, were it not from fear of her power over their
      lives and cattle, might have ended in her death. None, however, had
      courage to grapple with her, or to attempt expelling her by violence, lest
      a signal vengeance might be taken on any who dared to injure a woman that
      could call in the terrible aid of the <i>Lianhan Shee</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this state of feeling they applied to the parish priest, who, on
      hearing the marvellous stories related concerning her, and on questioning
      each man closely upon his authority, could perceive, that, like most other
      reports, they were to be traced principally to the imagination and fears
      of the people. He ascertained, however, enough from Bartley Sullivan to
      justify a belief that there was something certainly uncommon about the
      woman; and being of a cold, phlegmatic disposition, with some humor, he
      desired them to go home, if they were wise&mdash;he shook his head
      mysteriously as he spoke&mdash;&ldquo;and do the woman no injury, if they didn&rsquo;t
      wish&mdash;&rdquo; and with this abrupt hint he sent them about their business.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, however, did not satisfy them. In the same parish lived a suspended
      priest, called Father Philip O&rsquo;Dallaghy, who supported himself, as most of
      them do, by curing certain diseases of the people&mdash;miraculously! He
      had no other means of subsistence, nor indeed did he seem strongly devoted
      to life, or to the pleasures it afforded. He was not addicted to those
      intemperate habits which characterize &ldquo;Blessed Priests&rdquo; in general;
      spirits he never tasted, nor any food that could be termed a luxury, or
      even a comfort. His communion with the people was brief, and marked by a
      tone of severe contemptuous misanthropy. He seldom stirred abroad except
      during morning, or in the evening twilight, when he might be seen gliding
      amidst the coming darkness, like a dissatisfied spirit. His life was an
      austere one, and his devotional practices were said to be of the most
      remorseful character. Such a man, in fact, was calculated to hold a
      powerful sway over the prejudices and superstitions of the people. This
      was true. His power was considered almost unlimited, and his life one that
      would not disgrace the highest saint in the calendar. There were not
      wanting some persons in the parish who hinted that Father Felix O&rsquo;Rourke,
      the parish priest, was himself rather reluctant to incur the displeasure,
      or challenge the power, of the <i>Lianhan Shee</i>, by, driving its victim
      out of the parish. The opinion of these persons was, in its distinct
      unvarnished reality, that Father Felix absolutely showed the white feather
      on this critical occasion&mdash;that he became shy, and begged leave to
      decline being introduced to this intractable pair&mdash;seeming to
      intimate that he did not at all relish adding them to the stock of his
      acquaintances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Philip they considered as a decided contrast to him on this point.
      His stern and severe manner, rugged, and, when occasion demanded, daring,
      they believed suitable to the qualities requisite for sustaining such an
      interview. They accordingly waited, on him; and after Bartley and his
      friends had given as faithful a report of the circumstances as,
      considering all things, could be expected, he told Bartley he would hear
      from Mrs. Sullivan&rsquo;s own lips the authentic narrative. This was quite
      satisfactory, and what was expected from him. As for himself, he appeared
      to take no particular interest in the matter, further than that of
      allaying the ferment and alarm which had spread through the parish. &ldquo;Plase
      your Reverence,&rdquo; said Bartley, &ldquo;she came in to Mary, and she alone in the
      house, and for the matther o&rsquo; that, I believe she laid hands upon her, and
      tossed and tumbled the crathur, and she but a sickly woman, through the
      four corners of the house. Not that Mary lets an so much, for she&rsquo;s
      afeard; but I know from her way, when she spakes about her, that it&rsquo;s
      thruth, your Reverence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t the <i>Lianhan Shee</i>,&rdquo; said one of them, &ldquo;put a
      sharp-pointed knife to her breast, wid a divilish intintion of makin&rsquo; her
      give the best of aitin&rsquo; an&rsquo; dhrinkin&rsquo; the house afforded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She got the victuals, to a sartinty,&rdquo; replied Bartley, &ldquo;and &lsquo;overlooked&rsquo; 
      my woman for her pains; for she&rsquo;s not the picture of herself since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every one now told some magnified and terrible circumstance, illustrating
      the formidable power of the <i>Lianhan Shee</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had finished, the sarcastic lip of the priest curled into an
      expression of irony and contempt; his brow, which was naturally black and
      heavy, darkened; and a keen, but rather a ferocious-looking eye, shot
      forth a glance, which, while it intimated disdain for those to whom it was
      directed, spoke also of a dark and troubled spirit in himself. The man
      seemed to brook with scorn the degrading situation of a religious quack,
      to which some incontrollable destiny had doomed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall see your wife to-morrow,&rdquo; said he to Bartley; &ldquo;and after hearing
      the plain account of what happened, I will consider what is best to be
      done with this dark, perhaps unhappy, perhaps guilty character; but
      whether dark, or unhappy, or guilty, I, for one, should not and will not
      avoid her. Go, and bring me word to-morrow evening, when I can see her on
      the following day. Begone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they withdrew, Father Philip paced his room for some time in silence
      and anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;infatuated people! sunk in superstition and ignorance,
      yet, perhaps, happier in your degradation than those who, in the pride of
      knowledge, can only look back upon a life of crime and misery. What is a
      sceptic? What is an infidel? Men who, when they will not submit to moral
      restraint, harden themselves into scepticism and infidelity, until in the
      headlong career of guilt, that which was first adopted to lull the outcry
      of conscience, is supported by the pretended pride of principle. Principle
      in a sceptic! Hollow and devilish lie! Would I have plunged into
      scepticism, had I not first violated the moral sanctions of religion?
      Never. I became an infidel, because I first became a villain! Writhing
      under a load of guilt, that which I wished might be true I soon forced
      myself to think true: and now&rdquo;&mdash;he here clenched his hands and
      groaned&mdash;&ldquo;now&mdash;ay&mdash;now&mdash;and hereafter&mdash;oh, that
      hereafter! Why can I not shake the thoughts of it from my conscience?
      Religion! Christianity! With all the hardness of an infidel&rsquo;s heart I feel
      your truth; because, if every man were the villain that infidelity would
      make him, then indeed might every man curse God for his existence bestowed
      upon him&mdash;as I would, but dare not do. Yet why can I not believe?&mdash;Alas!
      why should God accept an unrepentant heart? Am I not a hypocrite, mocking
      him by a guilty pretension to his power, and leading the dark into thicker
      darkness? Then these hands&mdash;blood!&mdash;broken vows!&mdash;ha! ha!
      ha! Well, go&mdash;let misery have its laugh, like the light that breaks
      from the thunder-cloud. Prefer Voltaire to Christ; sow the wind, and reap
      the whirlwind, as I have done&mdash;ha, ha, ha! Swim, world&mdash;swim
      about me! I have lost the ways of Providence, and am dark! She awaits me;
      but I broke the chain that galled us: yet it still rankles&mdash;still
      rankles!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The unhappy man threw himself into a chair in a paroxysm of frenzied
      agony. For more than an hour he sat in the same posture, until he became
      gradually hardened into a stiff, lethargic insensibility, callous and
      impervious to feeling, reason, or religion&mdash;an awful transition from
      a visitation of conscience so terrible as that which he had just suffered.
      At length he arose, and by walking moodily about, relapsed into his usual
      gloomy and restless character.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Bartley went home, he communicated to his wife Father Philip&rsquo;s
      intention of calling on the following day, to hear a correct account of
      the Lianhan Shee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, thin,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of it, for I intinded myself to go to
      him, any way, to get my new scapular consecrated. How-an&rsquo;-ever, as he&rsquo;s to
      come, I&rsquo;ll get a set of gospels for the boys an&rsquo; girls, an&rsquo; he can
      consecrate all when his hand&rsquo;s in. Aroon, Bartley, they say that man&rsquo;s so
      holy that he can do anything&mdash;ay, melt a body off the face o&rsquo; the
      earth, like snow off a ditch. Dear me, but the power they have is strange
      all out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use in gettin&rsquo; him anything to ate or dhrink,&rdquo; replied
      Bartley; &ldquo;he wouldn&rsquo;t take a glass o&rsquo; whiskey once in seven years. Throth,
      myself thinks he&rsquo;s a little too dry; sure he might be holy enough, an&rsquo; yet
      take a sup of an odd time. There&rsquo;s Father Felix, an&rsquo; though we all know
      he&rsquo;s far from bein&rsquo; so blessed a man as him, yet he has friendship an&rsquo; 
      neighborliness in him, an&rsquo; never refuses a glass in rason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you know what I was tould about Father Philip, Bartley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you that afther I hear it, Mary, my woman; you won&rsquo;t expect me
      to tell what I don&rsquo;t know?&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behave, Bartley, an&rsquo; quit your jokin&rsquo; now, at all evints; keep it till
      we&rsquo;re talkin&rsquo; of somethin&rsquo; else, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t let us be committin&rsquo; sin,
      maybe, while we&rsquo;re spakin&rsquo; of what we&rsquo;re spakin&rsquo; about; but they say it&rsquo;s
      as thrue as the sun to the dial:&mdash;the Lent afore last itself it was,&mdash;he
      never tasted mate or dhrink durin&rsquo; the whole seven weeks! Oh, you needn&rsquo;t
      stare! it&rsquo;s well known by thim that has as much sinse as you&mdash;no, not
      so much as you&rsquo;d carry on the point o&rsquo; this knittin&rsquo;-needle. Well, sure
      the housekeeper an&rsquo; the two sarvants wondhered&mdash;faix, they couldn&rsquo;t
      do less&mdash;an&rsquo; took it into their heads to watch him closely; an&rsquo; what
      do you think&mdash;blessed be all the saints above!&mdash;what do you
      think they seen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Goodness above knows; for me&mdash;I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, thin, whin he was asleep they seen a small silk thread in his mouth,
      that came down through the ceilin&rsquo; from heaven, an&rsquo; he suckin&rsquo; it, just as
      a child would his mother&rsquo;s breast whin the crathur &lsquo;ud be asleep: so that
      was the way he was supported by the angels! An&rsquo; I remimber myself, though
      he&rsquo;s a dark, spare, yallow man at all times, yet he never looked half so
      fat an&rsquo; rosy as he did the same Lent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glory be to Heaven! Well, well&mdash;it is sthrange the power they have!
      As for him, I&rsquo;d as fee meet St. Pettier, or St. Pathrick himself, as him;
      for one can&rsquo;t but fear him, somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear him! Och, it &lsquo;ud be the pity o&rsquo; thim that &lsquo;ud do anything to vex or
      anger that man. Why, his very look &lsquo;ud wither thim, till there wouldn&rsquo;t be
      the thrack* o&rsquo; thim on the earth; an&rsquo; as for his curse, why it &lsquo;ud scorch
      thim to ashes!&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Track, foot-mark, put for life
</pre>
    <p>
      As it was generally known that Father Philip was to visit Mrs. Sullivan
      the next day, in order to hear an account of the mystery which filled the
      parish with such fear, a very great number of the parishioners were
      assembled in and about Bartley&rsquo;s long before he made his appearance. At
      length he was seen walking slowly down the road, with an open book in his
      hand, on the pages of which he looked from time to time. When he
      approached the house, those who were standing about it assembled in a
      body, and, with one consent, uncovered their heads, and asked his
      blessing. His appearance bespoke a mind ill at ease; his face was haggard,
      and his eyes bloodshot. On seeing the people kneel, he smiled with his
      usual bitterness, and, shaking his hand with an air of impatience over
      them, muttered some words, rather in mockery of the ceremony than
      otherwise. They then rose, and blessing themselves, put on their hats,
      rubbed the dust off their knees, and appeared to think themselves
      recruited by a peculiar accession of grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      On entering the house the same form was repeated; and when it was over,
      the best chair was placed for him by Mary&rsquo;s own hands, and the fire
      stirred up, and a line of respect drawn, within which none was to intrude,
      lest he might feel in any degree incommoded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good neighbor,&rdquo; said he to Mrs. Sullivan, &ldquo;what strange woman is this,
      who has thrown the parish into such a ferment? I&rsquo;m told she paid you a
      visit? Pray sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I humbly thank your Reverence,&rdquo; said Mary, curtseying lowly, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d
      rather not sit, sir, if you plase. I hope I know what respect manes, your
      Reverence. Barny Bradagh, I&rsquo;ll thank you to stand up, if you plase, an&rsquo; 
      his Reverence to the fore, Barny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ax your Reverence&rsquo;s pardon, an&rsquo; yours, too, Mrs. Sullivan: sure we
      didn&rsquo;t mane the disrespect, any how, sir, plase your Reverence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About this woman, and the <i>Lianhan Shee?</i>&rdquo; said the priest, without
      noticing Barny&rsquo;s apology. &ldquo;Pray what do you precisely understand by a <i>Lianhan
      Shee?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; replied Mary, &ldquo;some sthrange bein&rsquo; from the good people, or
      fairies, that sticks to some persons. There&rsquo;s a bargain, sir, your
      Reverence, made atween thim; an&rsquo; the divil, sir, that is, the ould boy&mdash;the
      saints about us!&mdash;has a hand in it. The <i>Lianhan Shee</i>, your
      Reverence, is never seen only by thim it keeps wid; but&mdash;hem!&mdash;it
      always, with the help of the ould boy, conthrives, sir, to make the person
      brake the agreement, an&rsquo; thin it has thim in its power; but if they don&rsquo;t
      brake the agreement, thin it&rsquo;s in their power. If they can get any body to
      put in their place, they may get out o&rsquo; the bargain; for they can, of a
      sartainty, give oceans o&rsquo; money to people, but can&rsquo;t take any themselves,
      plase your Reverence. But sure, where&rsquo;s the use o&rsquo; me to be tellin&rsquo; your
      Reverence what you know betther nor myself?&mdash;an&rsquo; why shouldn&rsquo;t you,
      or any one that has the power you have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled again at this in his own peculiar manner, and was proceeding to
      inquire more particularly into the nature of the interview between them,
      when the noise of feet, and sounds of general alarm, accompanied by a rush
      of people into the house, arrested his attention, and he hastily inquired
      into the cause of the commotion. Before he could receive a reply, however,
      the house was almost crowded; and it was not without considerable
      difficulty, that, by the exertions of Mrs. Sullivan and Bartley,
      sufficient order and quiet were obtained to hear distinctly what was said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plase your Reverence,&rdquo; said several voices at once, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re comin&rsquo;,
      hot-foot, into the very house to us! Was ever the likes seen! an&rsquo; they
      must know right well, sir, that you&rsquo;re widin in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are coming?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;Why the woman, sir, an&rsquo; her good pet, the
      <i>Lianhan Shee</i>, your Reverence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but why should you all appear so blanched with terror?
      Let her come in, and we shall see how far she is capable of injuring her
      fellow-creatures: some maniac,&rdquo; he muttered, in a low soliloquy, &ldquo;whom the
      villany of the world has driven into derangement&mdash;some victim to a
      hand like m&mdash;&mdash;. Well, they say there is a Providence, yet such
      things are permitted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s sayin&rsquo; a prayer now,&rdquo; observed one of them; &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t we a good right
      to be thankful that he&rsquo;s in the place wid us while she&rsquo;s in it, or dear
      knows what harm she might do us&mdash;maybe rise the wind!&rdquo;* As the latter
      speaker concluded, there was a dead silence. The persons about the door
      crushed each other backwards, their feet set out before them, and their
      shoulders laid with violent pressure against those who stood behind, for
      each felt anxious to avoid all danger of contact with a being against
      whose power even a blessed priest found it necessary to guard himself by a
      prayer.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * It is generally supposed by the people, that persons
     who have entered into a compact with Satan can raise
     the wind by calling him up, and that it cannot be laid
     unless by the death of a black cock, a black dog, or an
     unchristened child.
</pre>
    <p>
      At length a low murmur ran among the people&mdash;&ldquo;Father O&rsquo;Rourke!&mdash;here&rsquo;s
      Father O&rsquo;Rourke!&mdash;he has turned the corner after her, an&rsquo; they&rsquo;re
      both comin&rsquo; in.&rdquo; Immediately they entered, but it was quite evident from
      the manner of the worthy priest that he was unacquainted with the person
      of this singular being. When they crossed the threshold, the priest
      advanced, and expressed his surprise at the throng of people assembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plase your Reverence,&rdquo; said Bartley, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the woman,&rdquo; nodding
      significantly towards her as he spoke, but without looking at her person,
      lest the evil eye he dreaded so much might meet his, and give him &ldquo;the
      blast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dreaded female, on seeing the house in such a crowded state, started,
      paused, and glanced with some terror at the persons assembled. Her dress
      was not altered since her last visit; but her countenance, though more
      meagre and emaciated, expressed but little of the unsettled energy which
      then flashed from her eyes, and distorted her features by the depth of
      that mysterious excitement by which she had been agitated. Her countenance
      was still muffled as before, the awful protuberance rose from her
      shoulders, and the same band which Mrs. Sullivan had alluded to during
      their interview, was bound about the upper part of her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had already stood upwards of two minutes, during which the fall of a
      feather might be heard, yet none bade God bless her&mdash;no kind hand was
      extended to greet her&mdash;no heart warmed in affection towards her; on
      the contrary, every eye glanced at her, as a being marked with enmity
      towards God. Blanched faces and knit brows, the signs of fear and hatred,
      were turned upon her; her breath was considered pestilential, and her
      touch paralysis. There she stood, proscribed, avoided, and hunted like a
      tigress, all fearing to encounter, yet wishing to exterminate her! Who
      could she be?&mdash;or what had she done, that the finger of the Almighty
      marked her out for such a fearful weight of vengeance?
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Philip rose and advanced a few steps, until he stood confronting
      her. His person was tall, his features dark, severe, and solemn: and when
      the nature of the investigation about to take place is considered, it need
      not be wondered at, that the moment was, to those present, one of deep and
      impressive interest&mdash;such as a visible conflict between a supposed
      champion of God and a supernatural being was calculated to excite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Woman,&rdquo; said he, in his deep stern voice, &ldquo;tell me who and what you are,
      and why you assume a character of such a repulsive and mysterious nature,
      when it can entail only misery, shame, and persecution on yourself? I
      conjure you, in the name of Him after whose image you are created, to
      speak truly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and the tall figure stood mute before him. The silence was dead
      as death&mdash;every breath was hushed and the persons assembled stood
      immovable as statues! Still she spoke not; but the violent heaving of her
      breast evinced the internal working of some dreadful struggle. Her face
      before was pale&mdash;it was now ghastly; her lips became blue, and her
      eyes vacant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I conjure you in the name of the power by whom we
      live!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is probable that the agitation under which she labored was produced by
      the severe effort made to sustain the unexpected trial she had to undergo.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some minutes her struggle continued; but having begun at its highest
      pitch, it gradually subsided until it settled in a calmness which appeared
      fixed and awful as the resolution of despair. With breathless composure
      she turned round, and put back that part of her dress which concealed her
      face, except the band on her forehead, which she did not remove; having
      done this she turned again, and walked calmly towards Father Philip, with
      a deadly smile upon her thin lips. When within a step of where he stood,
      she paused, and riveting her eyes upon him exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who and what am I? The victim of infidelity and you, the bearer of a
      cursed existence, the scoff and scorn of the world, the monument of a
      broken vow and a guilty life, a being scourged by the scorpion lash of
      conscience, blasted by periodical insanity, pelted by the winter&rsquo;s storm,
      scorched by the summer&rsquo;s heat, withered by starvation, hated by man, and
      touched into my inmost spirit by the anticipated tortures of future
      misery. I have no rest for the sole of my foot, no repose for a head
      distracted by the contemplation of a guilty life; I am the unclean spirit
      which walketh to seek rest and findeth none; I am&mdash;<i>what you have
      made me!</i> Behold,&rdquo; she added, holding up the bottle, &ldquo;this failed, and
      I live to accuse you. But no, you are my husband&mdash;though our union
      was but a guilty form, and I will bury that in silence. You thought me
      dead, and you flew to avoid punishment&mdash;did you avoid it? No; the
      finger of God has written pain and punishment upon your brow. I have been
      in all characters, in all shapes, have spoken with the tongue of a
      peasant, moved in my natural sphere; but my knees were smitten, my brain
      stricken, and the wild malady which banishes me from society has been upon
      me for years. Such I am, and such, I say, have you made me. As for you,
      kind-hearted woman, there was nothing in this bottle but pure water. The
      interval of reason returned this day, and having remembered glimpses of
      our conversation, I came to apologize to you, and to explain the nature of
      my unhappy distemper, and to beg a little bread, which I have not tasted
      for two days. I at times conceive myself attended by an evil spirit shaped
      out by a guilty conscience, and this is the only familiar which attends
      me, and by it I have been dogged into madness through every turning of
      life. Whilst it lasts I am subject to spasms and convulsive starts which
      are exceedingly painful. The lump on my back is the robe I wore when
      innocent in my peaceful convent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The intensity of general interest was now transferred to Father Philip;
      every face was turned towards him, but he cared not. A solemn stillness
      yet prevailed among all present. From the moment she spoke, her eye drew
      his with the power of a basilisk. His pale face became like marble, not a
      muscle moved; and when she ceased speaking, his blood-shot eyes were still
      fixed upon her countenance with a gloomy calmness like that which precedes
      a tempest. They stood before each other, dreadful counterparts in guilt,
      for truly his spirit was as dark as hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he glanced angrily around him;&mdash;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what is
      it now, ye poor infatuated wretches, to trust in the sanctity of man.
      Learn from me to place the same confidence in God which you place in his
      guilty creatures, and you will not lean on a broken reed. Father O&rsquo;Rourke,
      you, too, witness my disgrace, but not my punishment. It is pleasant, no
      doubt, to have a topic for conversation at your Conferences; enjoy it. As
      for you, Margaret, if society lessen misery, we may be less miserable. But
      the band of your order, and the remembrance of your vow is on your
      forehead, like the mark of Cain&mdash;tear it off, and let it not blast a
      man who is the victim of prejudice still,&mdash;nay of superstition, as
      well as of guilt; tear it from my sight.&rdquo; His eyes kindled fearfully, as
      he attempted to pull it away by force.
    </p>
    <p>
      She calmly took it off, and he immediately tore it into pieces, and
      stamped upon the fragments as he flung them on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said the despairing man&mdash;&ldquo;come&mdash;there is a shelter for
      you, but no peace!&mdash;food, and drink, and raiment, but no peace!&mdash;no
      peace!&rdquo; As he uttered these words, in a voice that sank to its deepest
      pitch, he took her hand, and they both departed to his own residence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The amazement and horror of those who were assembled in Bartley&rsquo;s house
      cannot be described. Our readers may be assured that they deepened in
      character as they spread through the parish. An undefined, fear of this
      mysterious pair seized upon the people, for their images were associated
      in their minds with darkness and crime, and supernatural communion. The
      departing words of Father Philip rang in their ears: they trembled, and
      devoutly crossed themselves, as fancy again repeated the awful exclamation
      of the priest&mdash;&ldquo;No peace! no peace!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Father Philip and his unhappy associate went home, he instantly made
      her a surrender of his small property; but with difficulty did he command
      sufficient calmness to accomplish even this. He was distracted&mdash;his
      blood seemed to have been turned to fire&mdash;he clenched his hands, and
      he gnashed his teeth, and exhibited the wildest symptoms of madness. About
      ten o&rsquo;clock he desired fuel for a large fire to be brought into the
      kitchen, and got a strong cord, which he coiled and threw carelessly on
      the table. The family were then ordered to bed. About eleven they were all
      asleep; and at the solemn hour of twelve he heaped additional fuel upon
      the living turf, until the blaze shone with scorching light upon
      everything around. Dark and desolating was the tempest within him, as he
      paced, with agitated steps, before the crackling fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is risen!&rdquo; he exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;the spectre of all my crimes is risen
      to haunt me through life! I am a murderer&mdash;yet she lives, and my
      guilt is not the less! The stamp of eternal infamy is upon me&mdash;the
      finger of scorn will mark me out&mdash;the tongue of reproach will sting
      me like that of a serpent&mdash;the deadly touch of shame will cover me
      like a leper&mdash;the laws of society will crush the murderer, not the
      less that his wickedness in blood has miscarried: after that comes the
      black and terrible tribunal of the Almighty&rsquo;s vengeance&mdash;of his fiery
      indignation! Hush!&mdash;What sounds are those? They deepen&mdash;they
      deepen! Is it thunder? It cannot be the crackling of the blaze! It is
      thunder!&mdash;but it speaks only to my ear! Hush!&mdash;Great God, there
      is a change in my voice! It is hollow and supernatural! Could a change
      have come over me? Am I living? Could I have&mdash;&mdash;Hah!&mdash;Could
      I have departed? and am I now at length given over to the worm that never
      dies? If it be at my heart, I may feel it. God!&mdash;I am damned! Here is
      a viper twined about my limbs trying to dart its fangs into my heart! Hah!&mdash;there
      are feet pacing in the room, too, and I hear voices! I am surrounded by
      evil spirits! Who&rsquo;s there?&mdash;What are you?&mdash;Speak!&mdash;They are
      silent!&mdash;There is no answer! Again comes the thunder! But perchance
      this is not my place of punishment, and I will try to leave these horrible
      spirits!&rdquo;

    <p>
      He opened the door, and passed out into a small green field that lay
      behind the house. The night was calm, and the silence profound as death.
      Not a cloud obscured the heavens; the light of the moon fell upon the
      stillness of the scene around him, with all the touching beauty of a
      moonlit midnight in summer. Here he paused a moment, felt his brow, then
      his heart, the palpitations of which fell audibly upon his ear. He became
      somewhat cooler; the images of madness which had swept through his stormy
      brain disappeared, and were succeeded by a lethargic vacancy of thought,
      which almost deprived him of the consciousness of his own identity. From
      the green field he descended mechanically to a little glen which opened
      beside it. It was one of those delightful spots to which the heart
      clingeth. Its sloping sides were clothed with patches of wood, on the
      leaves of which the moonlight glanced with a soft lustre, rendered more
      beautiful by their stillness. That side on which the light could not fall,
      lay in deep shadow, which occasionally gave to the rocks and small
      projecting precipices an appearance of monstrous and unnatural life.
      Having passed through the tangled mazes of the glen, he at length reached
      its bottom, along which ran a brook, such as in the description of the
      poet,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &mdash;&mdash;In the leafy month of June,
     Unto the sleeping woods all night,
     Singeth a quiet tune.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Here he stood, and looked upon the green winding margin of the streamlet&mdash;but
      its song he heard not. With the workings of a guilty conscience, the
      beautiful in nature can have no association. He looked up the glen, but
      its picturesque windings, soft vistas, and wild underwood mingling with
      gray rocks and taller trees, all mellowed by the moonbeams, had no charms
      for him. He maintained a profound silence&mdash;but it was not the silence
      of peace or reflection. He endeavored to recall the scenes of the past
      day, but could not bring them back to his memory. Even the fiery tide of
      thought, which, like burning lava, seared his brain a few moments before,
      was now cold and hardened.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could remember nothing. The convulsion of his mind was over, and his
      faculties were impotent and collapsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this state he unconsciously retraced his steps, and had again reached
      the paddock adjoining his house, where, as he thought, the figure of his
      paramour stood before him. In a moment his former paroxysm returned, and
      with it the gloomy images of a guilty mind, charged with the extravagant
      horrors of brain-stricken madness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;the band still on your forehead! Tear it off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught at the form as he spoke, but there was no resistance to his
      grasp. On looking again towards the spot it had ceased to be visible. The
      storm within him arose once more; he rushed into the kitchen, where the
      fire blazed out with fiercer heat; again he imagined that the thunder came
      to his ears, but the thunderings which he heard were only the voice of
      conscience. Again his own footsteps and his voice sounded in his fancy as
      the footsteps and voices of fiends, with which his imagination peopled the
      room. His state and his existence seemed to him a confused and troubled
      dream; he tore his hair&mdash;threw it on the table&mdash;and immediately
      started back with a hollow groan; for his locks, which but a few hours
      before had been as black as a raven&rsquo;s wing, were now white as snow!
    </p>
    <p>
      On discovering this, he gave a low but frantic laugh. &ldquo;Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed; &ldquo;here is another mark&mdash;here is food for despair. Silently,
      but surely, did the hand of God work this, as proof that I am hopeless!
      But I will bear it; I will bear the sight! I now feel myself a man blasted
      by the eye of God Himself! Ha, ha, ha! Food for despair! Food for
      despair!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Immediately he passed into his own room, and approaching the looking-glass
      beheld a sight calculated to move a statue. His hair had become literally
      white, but the shades of his dark complexion, now distorted by terror and
      madness, flitted, as his features worked under the influence of his
      tremendous passions, into an expression so frightful, that deep fear came
      over himself. He snatched one of his razors, and fled from the glass to
      the kitchen. He looked upon the fire, and saw the white ashes lying around
      its edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the light is come! I see the sign. I am directed, and I
      will follow it. There is yet one hope. The immolation! I shall be saved,
      yet so as by fire. It is for this my hair has become white;&mdash;the
      sublime warning for my self-sacrifice! The color of ashes!&mdash;white&mdash;white!
      It is so! I will sacrifice my body in material fire, to save my soul from
      that which is eternal! But I had anticipated the sign. The self-sacrifice
      is accepted!&rdquo;*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * As the reader may be disposed to consider the nature
     of the priest&rsquo;s death an unjustifiable stretch of
     fiction, I have only to say in reply, that it is no
     fiction at all. It is not, I believe, more than forty,
     or perhaps fifty, years since a priest committed his
     body to the flames, for the purpose of saving his soul
     by an incrematory sacrifice. The object of the suicide
     being founded on the superstitious belief, that a
     priest guilty of great crimes possesses the privilege
     of securing salvation by self-sacrifice. We have heard
     two or three legends among the people in which this
     principle predominated. The outline of one of these,
     called &ldquo;The Young Priest and Brian Braar,&rdquo; was as
     follows:&mdash;

     A young priest on his way to the College of Valladolid,
     in Spain, was benighted; but found a lodging in a small
     inn on the roadside. Here he was tempted by a young
     maiden of great beauty, who, in the moment of his
     weakness, extorted from him a bond signed with his
     blood, binding himself to her forever. She turned out
     to be an evil spirit: and the young priest proceeded to
     Valladolid with a heavy heart, confessed his crime to
     the Superior, who sent him to the Pope, who sent him to
     a Friar in the County of Armagh, called Brian Braar,
     who sent him to the devil. The devil, on the strength
     of Brian Braar&rsquo;s letter, gave him a warm reception,
     held a cabinet council immediately, and laid the
     despatch before his colleagues, who agreed that the
     claimant should get back his bond from the brimstone
     lady who had inveigled him. She, however, obstinately
     refused to surrender it, and stood upon her bond, until
     threatened with being thrown three times into Brian
     Braar&rsquo;s furnace. This tamed her: the man got his bond,
     and returned to Brian Braar on earth. Now Brian Braar
     had for three years past abandoned God, and taken to
     the study of magic with the devil; a circumstance which
     accounts for his influence below. The young priest,
     having possessed himself of his bond, went to Lough
     Derg to wash away his sins; and Brian Braar, having
     also become penitent, the two worthies accompanied each
     other to the lake. On entering the boat, however, to
     cross over to the island, such a storm arose as drove
     them back. Brian assured his companion that he himself
     was the cause of it.

     &ldquo;There is now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but one more chance for me;
     and we must have recourse to it.&rdquo; He then returned
     homewards, and both had reached a hill-side near
     Bryan&rsquo;s house, when the latter desired the young priest
     to remain there a few minutes, and he would return to
     him; which he did with a hatchet in his hand.

     &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you must cut me into four quarters,
     and mince my body into small bits, then cast them into
     the air, and let them go with the wind.&rdquo;
 
     The priest, after much entreaty, complied with his
     wishes, and returned to Lough Derg, where he afterwards
     lived twelve years upon one meal of bread and water per
     diem. Having thus purified himself, he returned home;
     but, on passing the hill where he had minced the Friar,
     he was astonished to see the same man celebrating mass,
     attended by a very penitential looking congregation of
     spirits.

     &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Brian Braar, when mass was over, &ldquo;you are
     now a happy man. With regard to my state for the
     voluntary sacrifice I have made of myself, I am to be
     saved; but I must remain on this mountain until the Day
     of Judgment.&rdquo; So saying, he disappeared.

     There is little to be said about the superstition of
     the <i>Lianhan Shee</i>, except that it existed as we have
     drawn it, and that it is now fading fast away. There is
     also something appropriate in associating the heroine
     of this little story with the being called the <i>Lianhan
     Shee</i>, because, setting the superstition aside, any
     female who fell into her crime was called <i>Lianhan
     Shee</i>. <i>Lianhan Shee an Sogarth</i> signifies a priest&rsquo;s
     paramour, or, as the country people say, &ldquo;Miss.&rdquo; Both
     terms have now nearly become obsolete.
</pre>
    <p>
      We must here draw a veil over that which ensued, as the description of it
      would be both unnatural and revolting. Let it be sufficient to say, that
      the next morning he was found burned to a cinder, with the exception of
      his feet and legs, which remained as monuments of, perhaps, the most
      dreadful suicide that ever was committed by man. His razor, too, was found
      bloody, and several clots of gore were discovered about the hearth; from
      which circumstances it was plain that he had reduced his strength so much
      by loss of blood, that when he committed himself to the flames, he was
      unable, even had he been willing, to avoid the fiery and awful sacrifice
      of which he made himself the victim. If anything could deepen the the
      impression of fear and awe, already so general among the people, it was
      the unparalleled nature of his death. Its circumstances are yet remembered
      in the parish and county wherein it occurred&mdash;for it is no fiction,
      gentle reader! and the titular bishop who then presided over the diocese,
      declared, that while he lived, no person bearing the unhappy man&rsquo;s name
      should ever be admitted to the clerical order.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shock produced by his death struck the miserable woman into the utter
      darkness of settled derangement. She survived him some years, but wandered
      about through the province, still, according to the superstitious belief
      of the people, tormented by the terrible enmity of the <i>Lianhan Shee</i>.
      the <i>Lianhan Shee</i>.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
