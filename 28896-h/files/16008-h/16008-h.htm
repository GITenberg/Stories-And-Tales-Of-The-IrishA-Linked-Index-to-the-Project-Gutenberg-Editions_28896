    <h2>
      ELLEN DUNCAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are some griefs so deep and overwhelming, that even the best
      exertions of friendship and sympathy are unequal to the task of soothing
      or dispelling them. Such was the grief of Ellen Duncan, who was silently
      weeping in her lone cottage on the borders of Clare&mdash;a county at that
      time in a frightful state of anarchy and confusion. Owen Duncan, her
      husband, at the period about which our tale commences, resided in the
      cabin where he was born and reared, and to which, as well as a few acres
      of land adjoining, he had succeeded on the death of his father. They had
      not been long married, and never were husband and wife more attached.
      About this time outrages began to be perpetrated; and soon increased
      fearfully in number. Still Owen and Ellen lived happily, and without fear,
      as they were too poor for the marauders to dream of getting much booty by
      robbing; and their religion being known to be &ldquo;the ould religion ov all ov
      all,&rdquo; in a warfare that was exclusively one of party, they were more
      protected than otherwise. Owen never was particularly thrifty; and as his
      means were small, was generally embarrassed, or rather somewhat pinched in
      circumstances. Notwithstanding this, however, he was as happy as a king;
      and according to his unlettered neighbors&rsquo; artless praise, &ldquo;there wasn&rsquo;t a
      readier hand, nor an opener heart in the wide world&mdash;that&rsquo;s iv he had
      id&mdash;but he hadn&rsquo;t an&rsquo; more was the pity.&rdquo; His entire possessions
      consisted of the ground we have mentioned, most part of which was so rocky
      as to be entirely useless&mdash;a cow, a couple of pigs, and the &ldquo;the uld
      cabin,&rdquo; which consisted of four mud walls, covered with thatch, in which
      was an opening, &ldquo;to let in the day-light, an&rsquo; to let out the smoke.&rdquo; In
      the interior there was no division, or separate apartment, as the one room
      contained the cooking materials, and all other necessaries, beside their
      bed, which was placed close to the fire, and, of course, nearly under the
      opening in the roof. If any one spqke to Owen about the chances of rain
      coming down to where they slept, his universal answer was, &ldquo;Shure we&rsquo;re
      naither shugar nor salt, anyhow; an&rsquo; a dhrop ov or a thrifle ov wind, was
      niver known to do any body harm&mdash;barrin&rsquo; it brought the typhus; but
      God&rsquo;s good, an&rsquo; ordhers all for the best.&rdquo; Owen had been brought up in
      this way, and so he could live by his labor, he never thought of needless
      luxuries; and Ellen, seeing him contented, was so herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some months previous to the time of which we write, Owen&rsquo;s affairs had
      been gradually getting worse and worse; and it was with no pleasing
      anticipations that he looked forward to his approaching rent day. His
      uneasiness he studiously kept a secret from his wife, and worked away
      seemingly with as much cheerfulness as ever, hoping for better days, and
      <i>trusting in Providence!</i> However, when within a week of the time
      that he expected a call from the agent, he found that with all his
      industry he had been only able to muster five and twenty shillings, and
      his rent was above five pounds. So, after a good deal of painful
      deliberation, he thought of selling his single cow, thinking that by
      redoubled exertion he might after a while be enabled to repurchase her;
      forgetting, that before the cow was sold was really the time to make the
      exertion. A circumstance that greatly damped his ardor in this design was
      the idea of his wife&rsquo;s not acquiescing in it; and one evening, as they sat
      together by the light of the wood and turf fire, he thus opened his mind&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ellen, asthore, its myself that&rsquo;s sorry I haven&rsquo;t a fine large cabin, and
      a power o&rsquo; money, to make you happier an&rsquo; comfortabler than you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Owen,&rdquo; she interrupted, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know I&rsquo;m very happy? an&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t I
      often tell you, that it was the will of Providence that we shud be poor&rsquo;?
      So it&rsquo;s sinful to be wishin&rsquo; for riches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bud, Ellen acushla, it&rsquo;s growi&rsquo;n&rsquo; worse wid us every day; an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m afeard
      the trouble is goin&rsquo; to come on us. You know how hard the master&rsquo;s new
      agint is&mdash;how he sould Paddy Murphy&rsquo;s cow, an&rsquo; turned him out, bekase
      he couldn&rsquo;t pay his rint; an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m afeard I&rsquo;ll have to sell <i>Black Bess</i>,&rsquo; 
      to prevint his doin&rsquo; the same wid us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Owen agra, we mustn&rsquo;t murmur for our disthresses; so do whatever
      you think right&mdash;times won&rsquo;t be always as they are now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bud, Ellen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re forgettin&rsquo; how you&rsquo;ll miss the dhrop ov
      milk, an&rsquo; the bit of fresh butter, fur whin we part wid the poor baste,
      you won&rsquo;t have even thim to comfort you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, an&rsquo; iv I do miss them, Owen,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;shure it&rsquo;s no
      matther, considherin&rsquo; the bein&rsquo; turned out ov one&rsquo;s home into the world.
      Remember the ould sayin&rsquo; ov, &lsquo;out ov two evils always chuse the laste;&rsquo; 
      an&rsquo; so, darlint, jist do whatever you think is fur the best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this conversation, it was agreed on by both that Owen should set out
      the next day but one for the town, to try and dispose of the &ldquo;cow, the
      crathur;&rdquo; and although poverty had begun to grind them a little, still
      they had enough to eat, and slept tranquilly. However, it so happened,
      that the very morning on which he had appointed to set out, <i>Black Bess</i>
      was seized for a long arrear of a tax that had not been either asked or
      paid there for some time, and driven off, with many others belonging to
      his neighbors, to be sold. Now you must know, good reader, that there is a
      feeling interwoven, as it were, in the Irish nature, that will doggedly
      resist anything that it conceives in the slightest or most remote degree
      oppressive or unjust; and that feeling then completely usurped all others
      in Owen&rsquo;s mind. He went amongst his friends, and they condoled with one
      another about their grievances; there was many a promise exchanged, that
      they would stand by each other in their future resistance to what they
      considered an unlawful impost. When the rent-day came, by disposing of his
      two pigs, and by borrowing a little, he was enabled to pay the full
      amount, and thus protract for some time the fear &ldquo;ov bein&rsquo; turned out on
      the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some days after the whole country was in a tumult&mdash;Daly, &ldquo;the
      procthor,&rdquo; was found murdered in the centre of the high road; and there
      was no clue perceptible, by which the perpetrators of the crime could be
      discovered. The very day before, Owen had borrowed the game-keeper&rsquo;s gun,
      to go, as he said, to a wild, mountainous part of the country to shoot
      hares; and from this circumstance, and his not having returned the day
      after, a strong feeling of suspicion against him was in the minds of most.
      In fact, on the very evening that we have represented Ellen sitting in
      tears, the police had come to the cabin in search of him; and their report
      to the magistrate was, that he had absconded. His wife was in a miserable
      state of mind, and her whole soul was tortured with conflicting emotions.
      Owen&rsquo;s long absence, as well as his borrowing the gun, seemed to bespeak
      his guilt; and yet, when she recollected the gentleness of his manner, and
      his hitherto blameless life, she could not deem him so, no matter how
      circumstances seemed against him. But then, the harrowing idea that it
      might be, came in to blast these newly formed hopes, and her state of
      suspense was one of deep and acute misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sitting, as we have said, alone; the fire, that had consisted of
      two or three sods of turf heaped upon the floor, had almost entirely gone
      out; the stools and bosses were tossed negligently here and there; and the
      appearance of the entire apartment was quite different from its usual neat
      and tidy trim. Her head was bent a little, and her hands were clasped
      tightly around her knees, while her body was swaying to and fro, as if the
      agitation of her mind would not allow of its repose. Her eyes were dry,
      but red from former weeping; and she was occasionally muttering, &ldquo;No, he
      can&rsquo;t be guilty&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Owen commit a murdher!&mdash;It must be an
      untruth!&rdquo; and such like expressions. Gradually, as she thus thought aloud,
      her motions became more rapid, and her cheeks were no longer dry, while
      the light that entered through the open door becoming suddenly shaded, she
      turned round, and raised her tearful eyes to question the intruder. She
      sprang eagerly forward, and hung on his neck, (for it was Owen himself,)
      while she! joyfully exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, heaven be praised, yer come back at last, to give the lie to all
      their reports, an&rsquo; to prove yer innocence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ellen, my darlint,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d be glad to get me back,&rdquo;
       and he kissed! again and again her burning lips; &ldquo;but what do you mane,
      acushla?&mdash;What reports! do you spake ov, an&rsquo; ov what am I accused?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thin, Owen, I&rsquo;m glad you didn&rsquo;t even hear ov id; an&rsquo; the poliss here
      searchin&rsquo; the house to make you pres&rsquo;ner. Shure, avick, Bill Daly, the
      procthor, that sazed poor Black Bess, was murdhered the very mornin&rsquo; you
      wint to shoot the hares; an&rsquo; on account ov yer borryin&rsquo; the gun, an&rsquo; 
      threatenin&rsquo; him the day ov the sale, they said it was you that done id;
      but I gev thim all the lie, fur I knew you wor innocent. Now, Owen,
      ahagur, you look tired, sit down, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll get you somethin&rsquo; to ate. Och,
      bud I&rsquo;m &lsquo;glad that yer returned safe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The overjoyed wife soon heaped fresh turf on the fire, and partly blowing,
      partly fanning it into a flame, hung a large iron pot I over it, from a
      hook firmly fixed in the wall. While these preparations were going
      forward, Owen laid aside his rough outside coat, and going to the door,
      looked out, as if in irresolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ellen,&rdquo; at length said he, turning suddenly round, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; that I&rsquo;d
      betther go to the poliss barrack an&rsquo; surrindher&mdash;or rather, see what
      they have to say agin me; as I&rsquo;m an innocent man, I&rsquo;ve no dhread; an&rsquo; if I
      wait till they come an&rsquo; take me, it&rsquo;ll look as iv I was afeard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thrue for you, agra,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;bud it&rsquo;s time enough yit a bit&mdash;no
      one knows ov yer bein&rsquo; here. You look slaved, an&rsquo; had betther rest
      yerself, an&rsquo; ate a pratee or two. I have no milk ov my own to offer you
      now, but I&rsquo;ll go an&rsquo; thry an&rsquo; get a dhrop from a neighbor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Ellen returned with a little wooden noggin full, her husband was
      sitting warming his hands over the fire; and it was then she recollected
      that he had not brought back the gun with him; besides, when she cast a
      glance at his clothes, they were all soiled with mud and clay, and torn in
      many places. But these circumstances did not for a moment operate in her
      mind against him, for she knew from the very manner of his first question,
      and the innocence of his exclamation, that the accusations and suspicions
      were all false. Even though he had not attempted to explain the cause of
      his protracted absence, she felt conscious that it was not guilt, and
      forbore to ask any question about it. It was he first opened the subject,
      as they sat together over their frugal meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ellen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;sence I saw you last, I wint through a dale ov
      hardship; an&rsquo; I little thought, on my return, that I&rsquo;d be accused ov so
      black a crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Och, shure enough, Owen darlint; but I hope it &lsquo;ill be all for the best.
      I little thought I&rsquo;d see the day that you&rsquo;d be suspected ov murdher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Ellen aroon, all&rsquo;s in it is, it can&rsquo;t be helped. Bud as I was
      sayin&rsquo;&mdash;whin I left this, I cut acrass by Sheemus Doyle&rsquo;s, an&rsquo; so up
      into the mountain, where I knew the hares were coorsin&rsquo; about in plenty. I
      shot two or three ov thim; an&rsquo; as night began to fall, I was thinkin&rsquo; ov
      comin&rsquo; home, whin I heerd the barkin&rsquo; ov a dog a little farther up, in the
      wild part, where I never ventured afore. I dunna what prompted me to folly
      id bud, any how, I did, an&rsquo; wint on farther an&rsquo; farther. Well, Ellen agra,
      I at last come to a deep valley, full up a&rsquo;most of furze an&rsquo; brambles, an&rsquo; 
      I seen a black thing runnin&rsquo; down the edge ov id. It was so far off, I
      thought it was a hare, an&rsquo; so I lets fly, an&rsquo; it rowled over an&rsquo; over.
      Whin I dhrew near, what was it bud a purty black spaniel; an&rsquo; you may be
      shure I was sorry for shootin&rsquo; it, an&rsquo; makin&rsquo; such a mistake. I lays down
      the gun, an&rsquo; takes id in my arms, an&rsquo; the poor crathur licked the hand
      that shot id. Thin suddenly there comes up three sthrange min, an&rsquo; sazin&rsquo; 
      me as if I wor a child, they carrid me down wid them, cursin&rsquo; an&rsquo; abusin&rsquo; 
      me all the way. As they made me take a solemn oath not to revale what I
      saw there, I can&rsquo;t tell you any more: but they thrated me badly, an&rsquo; it
      was only yestherday I escaped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Owen, ahagur, we ought to be thankful that you&rsquo;re back here safe;
      bud do you think the magisthrate will be satisfied with this story&mdash;they
      are always anxious to do justice, but they must be satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In throth, they are, machree: but shure I&rsquo;ll sware to id; an&rsquo;, besides,
      you know, the raal murdherer may be discovered&mdash;for God never lets
      it, ov all other crimes, go athout punishment. An&rsquo; now I&rsquo;ll just go to the
      barracks at onst, an&rsquo; be out ov suspinse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ere Duncan had concluded his sentence, the tramp of feet was heard
      outside, and in a few seconds the cabin was full of armed men, who came to
      take him prisoner. He had been seen entering his cabin; and they
      immediately, as soon as they could muster a party, set out to make him
      captive. As he was known to most of them, and did not make the slightest
      attempt at resistance, they treated him gently, but bound his hands firmly
      behind his back, and took every necessary precaution. Though Ellen, while
      it seemed at a distance, had conversed calmly about his surrender, she was
      violently agitated at the appearance of the armed force. She clung to her
      husband&rsquo;s knees, and refused to part with him, wildly screaming, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
      innocent! My husband&rsquo;s innocent!&rdquo; and when all was prepared, she walked by
      his side to the magistrate&rsquo;s house, (a distance of three miles,) her
      choking sobs and burning tears attesting the violence of her uncontrolled
      feelings. A short examination was gone through there; and the
      circumstantial evidence that was adduced made the case look very serious.
      One man positively swore, that he had seen Duncan pass by in the morning,
      in the direction where the body was found, and that he was armed with a
      gun. Another, that in about an hour afterwards he had heard a shot, but
      supposed it was some person coursing, and that the report was just where
      the body was found, and where Owen had been seen proceeding to. His only
      cow having been seized by Daly, a threat that he was heard uttering, and
      his absence from home, was duly commented on; and finally, he was
      committed to prison to abide his trial at the Ennis Assizes. While all
      this was going forward, Ellen&rsquo;s emotions were most agonizing. She stared
      wildly at the magistrate and the two witnesses; and as the evidence was
      proceeded with, she sometimes hastily put back her hair, as if she thought
      she was under the influence of a dream. But when his final committal was
      made out, and her mind glanced rapidly at the concurrent testimony, and
      the danger of Owen, she rushed forward, and flinging her arms round him,
      wildly exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They shan&rsquo;t part us&mdash;they shan&rsquo;t tear us asunder! No, no, Owen, I
      will go wid you to preson! Oh, is id come to this wid us?&mdash;You to be
      dhragged from home, accused of murdher&mdash;and I&mdash;I&mdash;Father of
      marcies, keep me in my sinses&mdash;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; mad&mdash;wild, wild mad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ellen!&rdquo; said Owen, gently unwinding her arms, and kissing her forehead,
      while a scalding tear fell from his eye on her cheek&mdash;&ldquo;Ellen, asthore
      machree! don&rsquo;t be overcome. There&rsquo;s a good girl, dhry yer eyes. That God
      that knows I&rsquo;m guiltless, &lsquo;ill bring me safe through all. May his blessin&rsquo; 
      be on you, my poor colleen, till we meet agin! You know you can come an&rsquo; 
      see me. Heaven purtect you, Ellen, alanna!&mdash;Heaven purtect you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he was finally removed, she seemed to lose all power, and but for the
      arm of a bystander would have fallen to the ground. It was not without
      assistance that she was at length enabled to reach her cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is strange how man&rsquo;s feelings and powers are swayed by outward
      circumstances, and how his pride and strength may be entirely overcome by
      disheartening appearances! So it was with Owen: although constantly
      visited in prison by his faithful wife&mdash;although conscious of his own
      innocence&mdash;and although daily receiving assurances of hope from a
      numerous circle of friends&mdash;yet still his spirit drooped; the gloom
      of imprisonment, the idea of danger, the ignominy of public execution and
      all the horrors of innocent conviction, gradually wore away his mental
      strength; and when the assize time approached, he was but a thin shadow of
      the former bluff, healthy Owen Duncan. In so short a time as this, can
      care and harrowing thought exercise its influence on the human frame!
    </p>
    <p>
      Never was there a finer or more heavenly morning than that which ushered
      in the day of trial. The court-house was crowded to suffocation, the mob
      outside fearfully numerous, and never before, perhaps, was Ennis in such a
      state of feverish excitement. Daly&rsquo;s murder was as nought in the minds of
      all, in comparison with Duncan&rsquo;s accusation. Alas! the former was an
      occurrence of too frequent repetition, to be very much thought of; but the
      latter&mdash;namely, Owen&rsquo;s being suspected&mdash;was a subject of the
      extremest wonder. His former high character&mdash;his sobriety&mdash;his
      quietness, and his being a native of the town, in some measure accounted
      for this latter feeling; and there was an inward conviction in most men&rsquo;s
      minds, that he was guiltless of the crime for which he was accused.
      Although the court-house was crowded, yet when the prisoner was called to
      the bar, a pin could be heard to drop in any part of the place. There was
      a single female figure leaning on the arm of an aged and silver-haired,
      though hale and healthy countryman, within a few feet of the dock; and as
      the prisoner advanced, and laying his hand on the iron railing, confronted
      the judges and the court, she slowly raised the hood of the cloak, in
      which she was completely muffled, and gazed long and earnestly on his
      face. There was in that wistful look, a fear&mdash;a hope&mdash;an undying
      tenderness; and when his eye met hers, there was a proud, yet soft and
      warm expression in its glance, that reassured her sinking heart. As she
      looked round on the court, and the many strange faces, and all the
      striking paraphernalia of justice, a slight shudder crept silently over
      her frame, and she clung closer to her companion, as if to ask for all the
      protection he could afford. It was Ellen and her father who came, the
      former summoned as a witness, and the latter to accompany and support the
      daughter of his aged heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Duncan was arraigned: and on being asked the usual question of &ldquo;guilty, or
      not guilty?&rdquo; he answered in a clear, calm voice, &ldquo;Not guilty, my Lord!&rdquo;
       and the trial proceeded. The same evidence that was given at the
      magistrate&rsquo;s house was a second time repeated; and, evidently, its train
      of circumstances made a deep impression on the court. While the first part
      of the examination was going forward, Ellen remained as motionless as a
      statue, scarcely daring to move or breathe; but when the depositions went
      more and more against Owen, her respirations became quick, short, and
      gaspish; and when the crier desired her to get up on the table, it was
      with difficulty that she obeyed him. When seated, she gazed timidly round
      on the crowd of counsellors and the judges, as though to bespeak their
      sympathy; but then, not meeting a single glance from which to glean even
      the shadow of hope, she covered her face with her hands. A moment or two
      elapsed, and she grew more assured, and the counsel for the Crown
      proceeded with the examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ellen Duncan, is not that your name?&rdquo; was the first question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, Sir,&rdquo; she shrinkingly answered, without raising her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the prisoner at the bar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I know the pres&rsquo;ner at the bar?&rdquo; she reiterated; &ldquo;do I know Owen
      Duncan? Shure, isn&rsquo;t he my husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you recollect the night of the twenty-first of September?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, Sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you swear to whether your husband was at home on that night or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice faltered a little as she answered in the negative; and on the
      presiding judge repeating the question, with the addition of, &ldquo;Did he
      return at all next day?&rdquo; it seemed as if she first thought that her
      answers might criminate him still farther, and clasping her I hands
      convulsively together, and raising her face to the bench, while the
      scalding tears chased each other down her sunken cheek, she passionately
      exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, for the love of heaven, don&rsquo;t ask me any thing that &lsquo;ill be worse for
      him! Don&rsquo;t, counsellor jewel, don&rsquo;t! don&rsquo;t ask me to swear any thing that
      &lsquo;ill do him harm; for I can&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m sayin&rsquo; now, as the heart
      within me is growin&rsquo; wake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a few cheering expressions from the bench, who evidently were much
      moved by her simply energetic language and action, she was asked whether
      she could tell the Court where her husband spent that and the following
      nights; and with all the eagerness that an instantaneously formed idea of
      serving him could give, she answered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yis! yis! my Lord, I can. He was in the mountains shootin&rsquo; wid Phil
      Doran&rsquo;s gun, an&rsquo; he was sazed by some men, that made him stop wid thim,
      an&rsquo; take an oath not to revale who they wor, an&rsquo; they thrated him badly;
      so afther three days he made his escape, and come home to the cabin, whin
      he was taken by the poliss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word more, an&rsquo; you may go down&mdash;What was done with that gun?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge&rsquo;s hard and unmoved tone of voice seemed to bring misgiving to
      her mind, and she trembled from head to foot as she falteringly answered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wild boys of the mountain kep&rsquo; it, my Lord, an&rsquo; so he couldn&rsquo;t bring
      id home wid him. But, indeed, my Lord, indeed he&rsquo;s innocent&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      swear he never done it! Fur, oh! iv you knew the tindherness ov his heart&mdash;he
      that niver hurt a fly! Don&rsquo;t be hard on him for the love ov mercy, an&rsquo; 
      I&rsquo;ll pray for you night an&rsquo; day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the last question she was asked, and having left the table, and
      regained her former position by her father&rsquo;s side, she listened with
      moveless, motionless intensity to the judge&rsquo;s &ldquo;charge.&rdquo; He recapitulated
      the evidence&mdash;dwelt on the strong circumstances that seemed to
      bespeak his guilt&mdash;spoke of the mournful increase of crime&mdash;of
      laws, and life, and property being at stake&mdash;and finally closed his
      address with a sentence expressive of the extreme improbability of the
      prisoner&rsquo;s defence; for he, on being asked if he had any thing further to
      say, replied in the negative, only asserting, in the most solemn manner,
      his innocence of the charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jury retired, and Ellen&rsquo;s hard, short breathings, alone told that she
      existed. Her head was thrown back, her lips apart, and slightly quivering,
      and her eyes fixedly gazing on the empty box, with an anxious and wild
      stare of hope and suspense. Owen&rsquo;s face was very pale, and his lips livid&mdash;there
      was the slightest perceptible emotion about the muscles of his mouth, but
      his eye quailed not, and his broad brow had the impress of an unquenched
      spirit as firmly fixed as ever on its marble front. A quarter of an hour
      elapsed, and still the same agonizing suspense&mdash;another, and the jury
      returned not&mdash;five minutes, and they reentered. Ellen&rsquo;s heart, beat
      as if it would burst her bosom; and Owen&rsquo;s pale cheek became a little more
      flushed, and his eye full of anxiety. The foreman in a measured,
      feelingless tone pronounced the word &ldquo;Guilty!&rdquo; and a thrill of horror
      passed through the entire court, while that sickness which agonizes the
      very depths of the soul convulsed Owen&rsquo;s face with a momentary spasm, and
      he faltered &ldquo;God&rsquo;s will be done.&rdquo; The judge slowly drew on the black cap,
      and still Ellen moved not&mdash;it seemed as if the very blood within her
      veins was frozen, and that her life&rsquo;s pulses no more could execute their
      functions. No man, however brave or hardened, can view the near approach
      of certain death, and be unmoved; and as that old man, in tremulous tones,
      uttered the dread fiat of his fate, Owen&rsquo;s eyes seemed actually to sink
      within his head&mdash;the veins of his brow swelled and grew black, and
      his hands grasped the iron rail that surrounded the dock, as though he
      would force his fingers through it. When all was over, and the fearful cap
      drawn off, Ellen seemed only then to awake to consciousness. Her eyes
      slowly opened to their fullest extent&mdash;their expression of despair
      was absolutely frightful&mdash;a low, gurgling, half-choking sob forced
      itself from between her lips, and ere a hand could be outstretched to save
      her, she fell, as if quickly dashed to the ground by no mortal power&mdash;her
      piercing shriek of agony ringing through the court-house, with a fearful,
      prolonged cadence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evening approached, and the busy crowd of idlers had passed away, some to
      brood over what they had seen, and others to forget, in the bustle of
      life, that there were woes and miseries in the hearts of their
      fellow-beings. Owen was remanded to prison, as his execution was not to
      take place till the commission was over, thus giving him more than a week
      to prepare for that final doom. The light that struggled through the bars
      of his cell rested fully on the stooping figure of his wife, as she bent
      over the rude bed on which he lay; and her hot tears fell fast down her
      cheeks, as she thought how soon they were doomed to part for ever. Hope
      was not, however, entirely dead within her, for the jury had strongly
      recommended him to mercy; and ignorant as she was of forms and ceremonies&mdash;helpless
      as a lone woman in misfortune always is&mdash;she had determined on going
      to Dublin, to kneel at the feet of the Lord Lieutenant&mdash;then the
      proud and whimsical Duke of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, and there to solicit
      his pardon. Having hesitated for some time as to the manner in which she
      should break it to him, and ask his advice, she thus began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Owen, dear Owen! do you know what I&rsquo;ve been thinkin&rsquo; ov, an&rsquo; where I&rsquo;ve
      been thinkin&rsquo; ov goin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      There was no answer returned for some time, and on looking at him more
      earnestly, she was astonished to find that he had sank into a profound
      slumber. &ldquo;Guilt,&rdquo; thought she, &ldquo;is not there!&rdquo; and her resolution was
      taken instantly&mdash;she would not wake him&mdash;she would not let him
      know her purpose&mdash;and if she succeeded, her eyes flashed through her
      tears at the anticipation of his rapturous surprise. Stooping lower, she
      gently pressed her lips to his; and kneeling beside his bed, poured forth
      a short but fervent prayer to Him in whom alone we can put our trust&mdash;&ldquo;In
      whose hand is the soul of every living-thing, and the breath of all
      mankind&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Who preserveth not the life of the wicked, but giveth
      right to the poor.&rdquo; There was something exceedingly and touchingly
      beautiful in the attitude of that young wife&mdash;her hands clasped, her
      lips moving with her prayer, like rose-leaves with the evening breeze, and
      her upturned face, with its holy and deep religious expression. Having
      concluded her fervent petition, she noiselessly arose, and giving her
      sleeping husband one long and lingering look of affection, that death
      could not estrange, she silently glided from the cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third night from the events which we have narrated, a poor woman
      was observed wending her toilsome way through the streets of the
      metropolis. Her appearance bespoke fatigue and long travel; and as she
      neared the Upper Castle gate, she had to lean against the railing for
      support. The lamps were lighted, carriages rolling to and fro, and all the
      buzz of life was ringing in her ears; but, oh! from the expression of pain
      and suffering in her face, and the shrinking with which she surveyed the
      sentinels pacing up and down, it was evident that her mind but little
      accorded with the scenes by which she was surrounded. She slowly and
      fearfully entered the wide court-yard&mdash;a flood of light was streaming
      from the windows of the vice-regal dwelling, and a crowd of idlers stood
      around about, viewing the entrance of the visitors, for it appeared as if
      there were a revel of some kind going on. Ellen&rsquo;s heart sank within her,
      as she heard the carriages rolling and dashing across the pavement, for
      she felt that amid the bustle of company and splendor her poor appeal
      might be entirely unnoticed. As she waited, she saw several of the persons
      assembled thrust; rudely back by the soldiers that were on guard, and when
      she advanced a step or two for the purpose of entering, a brute in human
      shaped pushed her with a blow of the end of his musket back against the
      pillar. He was about to repeat his violence, when the poor creature fell
      on her knees before him and screamed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sojer darlin&rsquo;, don&rsquo;t stop me! I&rsquo;m only goin&rsquo; in to plade fur my husband&rsquo;s
      life, an shure you wont prevent me? I&rsquo;ve traveled many a wairy mile to get
      here in time; an&rsquo; oh! fur marcy&rsquo;s sake let me pass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the carriage of the eccentric and beautiful Lady &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      one of the wildest, strangest, and best-hearted females of the Irish
      Court, set down its lovely burden. She had seen the whole transaction of
      the sentinel, and heard Ellen&rsquo;s pathetic appeal, and her heart was
      instantly moved in her favor, for the example of fashion had not yet
      frozen up its finer feelings. Partly through the workings of a softened
      heart, and partly to make what was then all the rage, a scene or
      sensation, she resolved instantly to get her admitted to the presence of
      the Duke&mdash;nay, to present her herself. She was well known to be a
      favorite, and whatever whim of hers took place, no matter how extravagant,
      was sure to meet his hearty concurrence. She desired Ellen to rise and
      follow her; and the poor creature&rsquo;s eyes streamed with tears as she
      invoked a fervent blessing on the head of her lovely protectress. While
      passing up the grand staircase, amid the wondering gaze and suppressed
      titter of many a pampered menial, she instructed her how to proceed; and
      having received a hasty account of all, and desired her not to be
      faint-hearted, she turned to the simpering master of ceremonies to tell
      him of her &ldquo;dear delightful freak;&rdquo; there was a glad smile on her lip, and
      a glowing crimson on her cheek, but still there was a glistening moisture
      in her fine eyes, that told of soft and womanish feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke was sitting on a chair of crimson velvet; a cushion of the same
      costly material supported his feet; and he was looking with an appearance
      of apathy and ennui on the splendid group around him. The glitter of the
      lights, the lustre of the jewels, and the graceful waving of the
      many-colored plumes, gave every thing a courtly, sumptuous appearance, and
      the air was heavy with odors, the fragrant offering of many a costly
      exotic. Suddenly every eye was turned on the door with, wonder and
      astonishment, and every voice was hushed as Lady &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      entered, her cheeks blushing from excitement, and her eye bright with
      anticipated triumph. She led the poor and humbly clad Ellen by the hand,
      who dared not look up, but with her gaze riveted on the splendid carpet,
      was brought like an automaton to the feet of the Duke, where she
      mechanically knelt down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will yer Excillincy be plazed,&rdquo; began Lady &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      playfully mimicking the brogue, &ldquo;to hear this poor crathur&rsquo;s complaint.
      Her husband has been condimned to die for a murdher he didn&rsquo;t commit by no
      manner ov manes, as the sayin&rsquo; is; an&rsquo; as there was a sthrong
      recommindation to marcy, if you&rsquo;ll grant him a reprieve, you&rsquo;ll have all
      our prayers, and (in an under tone) your Excillincy knows you want thim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke seemed a little bewildered, as if he could not make out what it
      meant, and the glittering crowd now surrounded the group; when Ellen, who
      had ventured to look timidly up, conceived that the Duke hesitated about
      the pardon, (poor creature! she little knew that he had not even heard of
      Owen&rsquo;s trial,) eagerly grasped the drapery of his chair, and while the big
      tears rolled from beneath her eyelids, exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! may the great and just Providence, that sees the workin&rsquo; ov all our
      hearts, pour a blessin&rsquo; on yer Lordship&rsquo;s head&mdash;may His holy grace be
      wid you for iver an&rsquo; iver, an&rsquo; do listen to my prayers! My husband is
      innocent&mdash;an&rsquo; oh! as you hope for marcy at thee last day, be merciful
      now him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; said the Duke, &ldquo;what is the meaning of all
      this&mdash;will you explain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Excellency,&rdquo; answered she, in the natural sweet pathos of her tones,
      &ldquo;it is a poor man who has been condemned to die on circumstantial
      evidence. He has been strongly recommended to mercy, and this, weeping
      female is his wife, I found her outside praying for admission, and have
      brought her hither. She has traveled mostly on foot upwards of ninety
      miles to I ask a pardon; and I trust you will not refuse a reprieve, till
      your Grace has time to; inquire into the circumstance. &lsquo;This is the head
      and front of my offending.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May heaven bless yer Ladyship,&rdquo; burst from the depths of Ellen&rsquo;s grateful
      heart, &ldquo;fur befriendin&rsquo; thim that had no support but his gracious marcy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s suit was eagerly seconded by many a fair
      creature, who thronged around; and the Duke smiled, as he answered,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well! one could not refuse so many fair beseechers, so we will
      order him to be reprieved. And there, now, let the poor woman be removed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellen&rsquo;s heart was light, and her eye was glad, and her very inmost soul
      was thankful to the Omnipotent, as she that night rested for a. few hours,
      ere she set out on her return; and Lady &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, as she
      pressed her costly pillow, felt a fuller sense of happiness in being
      useful to her fellow-creature than ever she experienced before. Oh! that
      all the wealthy and in power were incited by similar feelings. The
      remainder of our simple tale is soon told. The reprieve arrived&mdash;the
      sentence was changed to banishment&mdash;and the very day appointed for
      Owen&rsquo;s death was that of his wife&rsquo;s successful return. One week previous
      to the embarkation of those sentenced to transportation, a man was to be
      executed for sheep-stealing. On the drop he confessed his guilt, and that
      he, and not Duncan, was the murderer of Daly. Owen was immediately
      released, and a subscription raised for him, with which, as well as with a
      weighty purse presented to Ellen by Lady &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, he took a
      comfortable farm, and rebought &ldquo;Black Bess.&rdquo;

      you bewitch our cattle now, Nanny? Whoo&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&mdash;at id
      agin, boys&mdash;that&rsquo;s your sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such were a few of the explosives of mingled fun and devilment that
      proceeded from a group of ragged urchins, who were busily employed in
      pelting with hard mud, sods and other missiles, an old and decrepit woman,
      whose gray hair and infirmities ought to have been her protection, but
      whose reputation as an evil disposed witch proved quite the contrary.
      Nanny, for such was her name, was leaning, or rather sitting, against a
      bank at the road side, shaking occasionally her crutch at her tormentors,
      and muttering a heavy curse as missile after missile fell thickly around
      her. The shouts of laughter proceeding from the annoying children, as she
      tried in vain to rise, and impotently threatened, made her imprecations
      come doubly bitter; but her eye was never wet, nor did she once even by a
      look appeal to their pity. Her figure was bent with age, and her shaking
      hands brown and fleshless&mdash;her hair was gray and wiry, and escaped
      from beneath her cap, in short, thin, tangled masses&mdash;her eyes were
      dark and deep set, and her lips and mouth had fallen in as her teeth had
      gradually decayed. She was clad in a russet gown, much the worse for the
      wear, and a scarlet cloak, or rather a cloak that had once been scarlet,
      but was now completely faded from its original color. It had been broken
      here and there, but was pieced with different colored cloths, so as to
      appear a motley and strange garment; and her bony feet were bare and
      unprotected. Nanny, from different circumstances, was unanimously elected
      the witch or bugbear of the village; and though the brats were then so
      busy annoying her, at night, or in a lonesome place, they would fly like
      lightning even at her approach; and some of them actually trembled while
      shouting, though they did not like to exhibit their fear to their
      companions. In the first place, she lived completely alone in a hovel on
      the mountain side, where, save heath, rock, and fern, there was not a
      single thing on which the eye could rest; then, no one knew from whence
      she came, and lights were frequently seen shining through her unglazed
      windows at hours when spirits were supposed to be abroad; besides, more
      than once a group of dark figures had been observed standing at twilight
      near her door, and were always set down as ministering demons, awaiting
      the pleasure of their mistress. Whenever a cow ceased giving milk&mdash;whenever
      a lamb or pig got any disease and died&mdash;it was unanimously attributed
      to the spite and venom of &ldquo;Nanny the witch;&rdquo; in fact, no human being could
      be viewed, with more mingled feelings of fear and hate than she was by all
      the inhabitants of the village. The boys still continued their unfeeling
      attack; and she now was silent and gloomy, and did not menace nor even
      mutter a curse, but her firmness had not left her, for her brow was darkly
      bent, and her small black eyes emitted a flash of wild though concentrated
      anger and revenge. Nor did those who passed from time to time, by word or
      gesture discourage the young urchins from their attack; sometimes they
      even stood looking complacently on, wondering at the reckless courage of
      the boys, as they would not for worlds dare to rise a hand against one so
      very powerful. Suddenly a louder whoop than any they had yet given, told
      that they had just invented some new mode of annoyance, and a short,
      hard-featured, red-headed boy, whom they called Briney, ran whooping and
      hallooing towards them, bearing a large hairy cap, which he triumphantly
      declared was full of rotten eggs&mdash;those delicious affairs which smash
      so delightfully off an unprotected face, and which used to be in great
      demand when pillories were in fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must have first shot!&rdquo; roared Briney, as he placed his burden down in
      the midst, and seized one of the eggs it contained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorra a bit, Briney!&rdquo; screamed another, striding before him&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a
      betther aim nor you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You a betther aim!&rdquo; scornfully retorted he; &ldquo;thry id:&rdquo; and his hand was
      upraised in the act of pelting, but was as suddenly stopped and withheld,
      as a pretty, tiny, fair-haired child, tripped forward from an opposite
      stile; and perceiving what was going on, ran quickly to the old woman, and
      laying down a pitcher that she bore, stood before her, facing the crowd of
      boys, her mild, soft blue eye flashing displeasure, and her cheeks flushed
      with a deep pink suffusion.

    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shame! oh, for shame!&rdquo; were the first exclamations that escaped her, and
      her sweet voice trembled with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bedad, it&rsquo;s purty Minny herself, sure enough!&rdquo; muttered one urchin to
      another, as they hesitated what to do, each evidently unwilling to
      encounter the reproaches they were sure of receiving; and one or two
      scampered off the instant she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then turning round to the old woman, and perceiving that her lips looked
      dry and parched, she ran to the pitcher, and lifting it to her mouth with
      much softness and compassion, exclaimed,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Nanny, you look dhry, an&rsquo; here&rsquo;s some wather. Take a little sup, an&rsquo; 
      it &lsquo;ill revive you! Oh; if I wor here a little bit sooner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nanny raised her eyes to thank her, and did as she requested; and it was
      indeed a touching thing to see that child in all the budding beauty of
      infancy, attending so anxiously on the withered female, whose name was
      seldom pronounced without dread or malediction. The urchins looked on for
      some time with open mouths and staring eyes; and then, headed by Briney,
      giving a farewell shout, to show they were not entirely disconcerted,
      bravely took to their heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May the blessins ov the poor and persecuted folly on yer path, my purty
      child!&rdquo; gratefully exclaimed the old woman, as her eyes rested on the
      cherub face and infantine figure of her protectress, and they now were
      dewy and wet with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I help you to rise, Nanny?&rdquo; asked she, her little heart dancing
      with pleasure at hearing the fervent wish: &ldquo;iv you like to go home, an&rsquo; 
      you think me sthrong enough, I&rsquo;ll help you on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From my heart I thank you, my purty golden haired child,&rdquo; said the old
      woman, as with her assistance she at length stood up; &ldquo;bud you seem to
      know who I am, and I wondher yer not afeard ov me. Minny, I think they
      called you&mdash;who is the happy father ov my little darlin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Minny Whelan,&rdquo; gently answered the little girl; upon which Nanny
      shrunk hastily back, and a fearful change overspread her features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Minny Whelan!&mdash;you the proctor&rsquo;s daughter? Those smiling lips&mdash;those
      tinder, soft eyes&mdash;that rich yellow hair&mdash;an&rsquo; that warm an&rsquo; 
      feelin&rsquo; heart, Minny Whelan&rsquo;s. Oh, it can&rsquo;t, it mustn&rsquo;t be&mdash;I won&rsquo;t
      believe id!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little girl laughed, although wonder lurked in her eye, and repeated
      innocently,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure enough, I am the procthor&rsquo;s daughter: bud you don&rsquo;t hate me for id&mdash;do
      you?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come close to me, child, till I look upon you,&rdquo; said Nanny, in a cold and
      altered tone of voice; and then, as Minny fearlessly advanced, she laid
      her aged hands on her head, and pushing back the profusion of her curling
      hair, looked long and anxiously on her. A hot tear fell upon the child&rsquo;s
      forehead as she withdrew her hand; and in a broken, voice the old woman
      exclaimed,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are&mdash;you are indeed his child; bud have naither his black look,
      nor his hard an&rsquo; baneful heart&mdash;so&mdash;so&mdash;I cannot hate you!
      For years I&rsquo;ve never met with kindness, till you wor kind. Minny, heaven
      &lsquo;ill reward; you for id; an&rsquo; may its blessin&rsquo; be wid you, is the prayer ov
      your father&rsquo;s bittherest foe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this the child hesitated for an instant, as if she did not comprehend
      the latter part of Nanny&rsquo;s sentence; and then innocently taking her hand,
      she looked up to her face and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bud maybe yer too tired to go home now all the ways, Nanny, so iv you&rsquo;ll
      come home wid me, I&rsquo;m sure my father won&rsquo;t be angry, an&rsquo; will&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go home wid you!&rdquo; wildly reiterated the old woman, her eyes blazing so
      fearfully, that the child shrunk instinctively back&mdash;&ldquo;crass your
      father&rsquo;s flure!&mdash;inther the man&rsquo;s house who sint my son&mdash;my only
      son!&mdash;my heart&rsquo;s blood!&mdash;from his native land, wid disgrace upon
      his name, and the heavy hand ov power crushin&rsquo; him to the earth! Never!&mdash;these
      eyes, that once could laugh wid happiness, will burn in their sockets
      first, and this withered heart, once so warm and joyful, will burst afore
      I ever think ov id!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nanny,&rdquo; tremblingly said Minny, &ldquo;you spake so wild you make me afeard&mdash;I
      hope I haven&rsquo;t done anything to vex you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You! Oh! no, no&mdash;you force me to love you! I couldn&rsquo;t hate you,
      although yer father&mdash;bud no matther. Minny, good bye&mdash;may the
      Almighty guard you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The day passed away as Summer days are wont, in softness and languor, and
      the sun descended in gold and crimson, leaving a bright halo in the west
      to mark his resting place. Night came on serene and still, and the quiet
      moon ascended her heavenly throne, while the refreshing dews fell upon the
      flowers, whose leaves opened to receive them, parched, as they were with
      the burning lustre of the mid-day sun. Midnight had already passed; and
      all was as silent as if no living or created thing existed upon the earth
      to mar its splendid beauty with the wild indulgence of its fiercer
      passions. A strong light was gleaming from the interior of Nanny&rsquo;s cabin,
      which we have already said was situated on the mountain side; and the
      noisy sounds of revelry were heard proceeding from within. Could any of
      the superstitious have summoned courage to approach sufficiently near, and
      listen for a moment, the idea of spirits would soon be dissipated in the
      bluff, hoarse voices which were laughing and grumbling, and singing,
      sometimes alternately, and sometimes all together. But we had better
      introduce the reader to the interior, and then he will be a better judge
      of the nature of the orgies carried on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cabin consisted of but one small apartment, in the centre of which
      blazed a, huge fire (summer though it was) of dried peat. The smoke sought
      egress where it might, but still left a sufficient canopy over the heads
      of the occupants, as completely to hide the dingy and charred rafters, and
      did not seem in the slightest degree to annoy the optical powers of any
      one, so accustomed where they to this kind of atmosphere. Round this fire
      about ten were seated or squatted down, and were all at the time busily
      employed in some noisy and apparently angry disputation. However, this did
      not prevent the bottle from being freely passed amongst them; and so
      cordial were they in embracing it, that Nanny, who sat a little apart, was
      often called on to replenish it with mountain-dew. On a table or dresser
      that stood by the wall, were three or four large pistols, besides an old
      sword or two, and a few rusted bayonets: piled against it were two large
      muskets, evidently kept with more care than the rest of the arms, for they
      were brightly polished, and looked even new. A couple of powder-horns, a
      tin box containing shot and bullets, and a large iron mallet, used in
      breaking open doors, completed the array, which could leave no doubt as to
      the men who occupied the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Nanny acushla, give us another dhrop of that you gev us last,&rdquo;
       exclaimed one, whose rolling eyes gave token, of approaching intoxication;
      &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not used to be sparin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; considherin&rsquo; the way you get id,
      needn&rsquo;t be so&mdash;eh? Dick, what do you say to another drink?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Game to the last,&rdquo; answered the man addressed&mdash;&ldquo;never refuse id.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Nanny,&rdquo; observed a low but muscularly formed man, who seemed from
      his manner to exercise some slight command amongst his associates, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s
      the matther wid you to-night? Sure we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to do what you&rsquo;ve long been
      axin&rsquo; us, an&rsquo; what you first gev us lave to meet here for&mdash;an&rsquo; by
      doin&rsquo; so we&rsquo;ve got the fame of bein&rsquo; not quite right. The villain of a
      procthor that suit poor Bob off afore he could look about him, &lsquo;ill resave
      his pay to-night, anyhow. What say you, boys?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt ov it!&mdash;All right!&mdash;Whoo! sartinly!&rdquo; they grumbled and
      shouted in reply; and then, the whiskey having been brought, the health of
      Nanny&rsquo;s absent son, and their companion, was loudly proposed and drank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Dick,&rdquo; hiccupped the first speaker, who now began to wax drunk,
      &ldquo;what is your op&mdash;op&mdash;opinion should, we do to ould Whelan? You
      know, I&rsquo;m (hiccup) not natherally crule, bud suppose (hiccup) we jist cut
      the ears off the baste, an&rsquo; (hiccup) lave him hard ov hearin&rsquo; for the rest
      ov his life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the man to disagree wid a rasonable iday,&rdquo; ironically answered
      Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say to that, my ould (hiccup) woman?&rdquo; again asked he,
      addressing Nanny, who had drawn near to listen; &ldquo;suppose we sarve him
      that-a-way, will you be (hiccup) satisfied; or maybe you&rsquo;d sooner we&rsquo;d
      prevint his bein&rsquo; annoyed wid a cough by (hiccup) cuttin&rsquo; his informin&rsquo; 
      throat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he spoke, an indescribable expression lighted up the old woman&rsquo;s
      eye, and she stood a moment, as if a struggle was going on between
      long-brooded-over revenge and some newly awakened sympathy. The rest of
      the men were busy with other schemes, and did not even hear the last
      conversation, for they had before agreed to pay Whelan a visit that night,
      and Nanny had eagerly entered into their intentions; for she had an only
      son, who, being wild and dissipated, had got connected with the very gang
      at present in her cabin, and through Whelan&rsquo;s means (he having informed
      against him) was transported. An Irish mother soon looks upon the faults
      of a darling child with levity: and when he was torn from her arms, in the
      madness of grief she had vowed vengeance against Whelan; and though he
      soon after removed to where he then was, she followed him, and took up her
      residence on the mountain, where, as she was a stranger, and had no
      apparent means of living, a report of her communion with evil spirits was
      soon spread abroad. This she rather encouraged than otherwise, by the
      advice of the men whom she fixed on as the completers of her revenge, and
      by such means the lights and nightly noises were placed to the account of
      anything but their real cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had endured many griefs, and many mortifications, from her reputation
      as a witch, but met every thing in that way with patience, as the dream of
      her soul was revenge, and that dream by such means alone could be
      realized. However, when on the very point of its completion, one of those
      sudden and mysterious changes which often takes place in the human mind
      made her waver in her purpose; and the child of her intended victim having
      behaved so tenderly and so kindly when all the rest hooted at and
      tormented her, made her fervently wish that she could turn the fierce men
      around her from that fell purpose which she herself had nourished till it
      grew into a fixed, and, she dreaded, an unalterable determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t yez betther wait,&rdquo; she tremblingly began, scarcely knowing what
      she was about to propose&mdash;&ldquo;another night &lsquo;ill do as well for Whelan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s this,&rdquo; interrupted one of them, &ldquo;Nanny, you growing lukewarm!&mdash;you
      proposin&rsquo; another night&mdash;are you beginnin&rsquo; to be afeard we&rsquo;ll be
      hindhered from payin&rsquo; him off, or are you repentin&rsquo; yer former anxious
      desire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no!&rdquo; hastily answered she, dreading lest they should discover
      her feelings, as she well knew that many amongst them had revenge to be
      gratified as well as herself; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t repine as regards him, bud&mdash;bud&mdash;his
      daughter&mdash;poor little Manny&mdash;the purty goolden-haired child!&mdash;I
      wouldn&rsquo;t like any thing &lsquo;ud harm her, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m afeard ov her bein&rsquo; hurted&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did not feel so six years ago,&rdquo; said a deep voice at her elbow, &ldquo;whin
      yer only son was sint off from home an&rsquo; counthry through his manes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nanny started, she knew not why, at the tones of the speaker, and turned
      round to look closer at him; but his back was towards her, and a large
      loose coat prevented all recognition of his person; besides, bringing an
      occasional newly enrolled stranger there, was a common circumstance, so
      she soon forgot the momentary surprise she had met in her anxiety about
      their intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a brute&mdash;his heart is harder nor steel, an&rsquo; he must be
      punished,&rdquo; said another, whose bent brow and flashing black eye spoke of
      malignity and crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But his child&mdash;his poor little Minny!&rdquo; exclaimed Nanny, &ldquo;sure you
      wouldn&rsquo;t injure her&mdash;she hasn&rsquo;t deserved id at yer hands&mdash;she
      has done nothin&rsquo;, but is a sweet an&rsquo; kind-hearted crathur. Oh! iv you had
      seen her whin I was in the village, an&rsquo; the boys were hootin&rsquo; an&rsquo; peltin&rsquo; 
      me, an&rsquo; no one interfered to protect the hated Nanny&mdash;iv you had seen
      the little angel how she stood before me, an&rsquo; cried out &lsquo;shame!&rsquo; an&rsquo; held
      up the pitcher for me to dhrink, an&rsquo; helped me to rise, offerin&rsquo; me the
      shelter of her father&rsquo;s house, little dhramin&rsquo; ov whom she was spakin&rsquo; to&mdash;you
      wouldn&rsquo;t have a thought ov hurtin&rsquo; her&mdash;bud&mdash;no one&mdash;no one
      could harm Minny!&mdash;-she is too sweet, too pure, too like a little
      angel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hair of the child&rsquo;s head shall not be touched!&rdquo; said the same deep
      voice that had before made Nanny start; &ldquo;bud he, the informher an&rsquo; the
      prosecuthor, must feel our vengeance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nanny was silent&mdash;she saw that further parley was useless, and was
      obliged to bear with the concession she had already obtained. Meanwhile,
      the men having ascertained that it was time they were stirring, hastily
      equipped themselves, and prepared to start. When. they were leaving the
      house, the stranger, whose voice had so startled her, took her hand, and
      though his face was studiously averted, she heard him say solemnly&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nanny, good bye!&mdash;my promise I&rsquo;ll keep sacred&mdash;the good child
      shall not be touched!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had not time to utter her thanks, for his hand as hastily relinquished
      its hold, and ere she could speak, all were gone, and she heard the buzz
      of their voices, as in a group they descended the mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bright moonbeams silvered the motionless leaves of the trees that
      surrounded Whelan&rsquo;s cottage&mdash;there was not a stir within&mdash;no
      light gleamed from the lattice, and the small thin brook that bubbled
      through the long grass a little in its front, seemed to hush its merry
      song to a mere low trickling sound, as if in unison with the universal
      repose. A dark group of figures stood in the little garden before the
      door, as if debating how they should act. Two of them, separated a little
      from the rest, conferred together, one of whom was the stranger we have
      already noticed, and the other the man we have spoken of as seeming to
      possess some command over them all. Suddenly the latter started, and
      exclaimed in the quick, sharp tone of command&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Advance, men, an&rsquo; smash the door&mdash;there&rsquo;s no use in delayin&rsquo; 
      longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An almost instantaneous crash was the answer, and the door flew from its
      hinges, and four or five of the men rushed into the cottage, while the
      rest kept watch outside. Exclamations of surprise, mingled with harsh,
      epithets, were heard within; and then they appeared a second time,
      dragging with them the unfortunate and trembling owner, whom they had just
      torn from his bed. A loud shout from the rest spoke their eagerness for
      his punishinent; and amidst prayers for mercy, and entreaties, he was
      dragged to the centre of the garden, placed on his knees; and his hands
      firmly tied behind his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Misther Whelan, <i>acushla</i>,&rdquo; asked! one, in a jeering tone,
      &ldquo;would you be jist pleased to make yer choice between two purty little
      invintions of ours&mdash;<i>cardin</i> an <i>ear-ticklin&rsquo;</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor man trembled violently, and his livid lips opened but he could
      not utter a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an obstinate, silent ould baste you are,&rdquo; said the same man, &ldquo;not to
      give a civil answer to my question. Bud maybe the look o&rsquo; this plaything
      id drive spake outov you&mdash;oh, you may stare now!&rdquo; Saying this, he
      drew forth a board with a thick handle, the bottom part of which was
      closely studded with nails and sharp pieces of iron, in imitation of the
      cards they use for wool, and continued&mdash;&ldquo;Would you admire the taste
      of this in the flesh on your back, my informin&rsquo; codger!&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon this, shouts of &ldquo;card him! card him!&rdquo; arose from the group, and his
      hands were quickly unloosed, and he was violently dashed on his face,
      while some held his legs and others his arms. Then his back was stripped,
      and the stranger laid the board flatly on it, with the iron points
      touching the flesh, while another stood up with the large mallet ready to
      drive them in, the shrieks of the victim becoming more and more faint.
      Just as the man who held the weapon last named was about to strike, and
      just as a demon grin of satisfied vengeance distorted the otherwise
      handsome features of the stranger, a light and tiny form flew screaming
      towards them, her long yellow hair floating in the night-breeze, and her
      white dress hanging loosely about her delicate limbs. It was Minny, who,
      unmindful of all, and seeing only her father, threw herself on her knees
      beside him, exclaiming in tones of agony:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my father&mdash;my dear father&mdash;what is the matter?&mdash;what
      are they goin&rsquo; to do wid you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger started at the tones of her voice, and on gazing at her for a
      moment, flung the card to a distance, and catching her in his arms, kissed
      away the tears which covered her cheeks, as she struggled for release.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it you,&rdquo; he said with much emotion, &ldquo;that I promised to purtect?&mdash;You,
      who succored an&rsquo; saved me when I was dyin&rsquo; for want? An&rsquo; are you the
      daughter ov Whelan the procthor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men, perplexed at the apparition of the child, mechanically had
      released their prisoner; and he, starting up with the sudden hope of
      freedom, stood confronting the stranger, who yet held his child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious Providence!&rdquo; he exclaimed in wonder, as the moonlight streamed
      on the face he was trying to recognize&mdash;&ldquo;Is id&mdash;can id be Robert
      Dillon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yis, Whelan!&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;it is the man you name&mdash;the man you
      caused to be thried an&rsquo; banished, an&rsquo; the man who came here to have
      revange!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh. don&rsquo;t hurt him&mdash;don&rsquo;t hurt him&mdash;he is <i>my</i> father,&rdquo;
       cried the little Minny who now also seemed to recognize him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Iv he was surrounded wid fiends,&rdquo; answered Dillon, kissing her fair
      smooth brow, &ldquo;iv he was for ever on the watch, I&rsquo;d still have my revenge:
      bud for your sake, sweet, good-natured child&mdash;for your sake, I&rsquo;ll not
      allow him to be touched!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A murmur here began to rise among some of the men, while the leader, with
      one or two others, seemed to take part with the returned son of Nanny
      Dillon. Upon this he added&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was weary an&rsquo; wake wid fatigue an&rsquo; hunger&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t move a step
      further than jist to lave the road an&rsquo; lie in a dhry ditch, as I thought,
      to die, jist as I complated the journey to my native place! But this
      little girl&mdash;this goolden-haired child&mdash;kem to me, an&rsquo; raised my
      head, an&rsquo; poured a sweet draught of milk into my mouth, an&rsquo; brought me
      food, an&rsquo; sat by me, an&rsquo; talked wid me, till I was at last able to join
      wid you! An&rsquo; afther this&mdash;afther this, would you have me harm any one
      belongin&rsquo; to her&mdash;even though he is my bitterest inimy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The quick changing of purpose&mdash;the sudden transitions of the Irish
      nature&mdash;are proverbial; and then those who had been loudest in their
      murmurs were loudest in their cries of approval; and a deep huzza of
      exultation at the magnanimity he displayed, told Dillon that he had little
      to fear from their opposition. So once more embracing the little girl, he
      gave her hand to her father, and taking the leader&rsquo;s arm, strode away,
      exclaiming:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whelan, you may thank your child&mdash;for &lsquo;tis she ha&rsquo;s saved you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The party all followed after him; and in a few moments more there was no
      trace of the scene of violence that had been partly enacted, and the
      brook&rsquo;s low bubblings, as before, alone disturbed the silence of the
      slumbering night.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will not attempt to describe poor Nanny&rsquo;s joy at her son&rsquo;s making
      himself known, and informing her of the circumstances that had taken place&mdash;enough
      to say, he had managed to escape before his time was out; but as no one
      informed against him, he was suffered to remain in peace, and manage a
      small farm in the next county, where he and his mother soon after retired,
      as he determined totally to forsake his old mischievous pranks.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were present at the village, altar, when Minny, who had grown up in
      beauty and gentleness, gave her hand to a youth&mdash;the selected one of
      her heart&mdash;and her gray-headed parent looked meekly on, blessing that
      Providence who had given him such a child. Providence who had given him
      such a child.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
